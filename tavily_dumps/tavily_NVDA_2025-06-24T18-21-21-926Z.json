Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n17.77% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA. Tickeron’s AI Trading Bots, including the Double Agent and Single Agent, cater to traders of all levels.

The Omniverse is being used in various fields, from architecture and engineering to entertainment, making NVIDIA a key player in developing the infrastructure for the metaverse.\nNvidia’s Virtual Reality\nIn the VR space, NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for creating high-quality virtual experiences. As VR technology continues to improve, the need for more powerful graphics processors will likely increase, boosting sales of NVIDIA’s high-end GPUs. The RTX series, known for its real-time ray tracing, is particularly suited for creating lifelike VR environments.\nWhat could we expect as an investor ?\nThe potential market for metaverse and VR technologies is huge. Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run. As these markets evolve, NVIDIA’s contributions to building metaverse infrastructure and enhancing VR capabilities may become key drivers of its stock performance.\nFor investors like us looking at NVIDIA’s long-term potential, it’s essential to keep an eye on developments in the metaverse and VR. While these sectors are filled with opportunity, their ever-changing nature also brings a degree of uncertainty. NVIDIA’s ability to seize these opportunities could shape its future market standing and stock value.\nConclusion\nLet’s conclude now what we have discussed in this article “Nvidia Stock Price Forecast for 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050” so far. We are not expecting Nvidia to rise much in 2025. As we have discussed in its historical analysis, this stock experienced a multi-bagger growth in its last 5 year term. So, in 2025, it may rise to ~ $170 which looks quite normal for a company with this kind of potential. But after 2025, when metaverse will get more light and people’s attention, it may again turn to a multi-bagger for you as we speak of 2035, 2040, 2050 and beyond.\nPlease Go through the FAQs for more clarity about this investment decision and share your thoughts/queries on this in our comments section.

Learn More\nNvidia Stock Prediction, From Someone Who Has Invested for Decades\nBy Jake Lerch – Jun 21, 2025 at 7:00AM \nKey Points\n\nThe big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia. \nAs competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit. \nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now › \n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nToday's Change\n(2.21%)$3.18\nCurrent Price\n$147.35\nPrice as of June 24, 2025, 2:13 p.m. ET\nIn the span of only a few years, Nvidia(NVDA 2.21%) has become one of the largest stocks in the world. Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoftas the world's largest company by market cap.\nThe engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed.\nHowever, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nNvidia's rise has been fueled by revenue and margin growth\nThere are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth.\nFirst, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%.\nHowever, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devicesand Intel.\n\nNVDA Gross Profit Margin data by YCharts\nHowever, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Appleare all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins.\nSo, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips.\nAmazon could reap the benefits as the AI chip market becomes more competitive\nUltimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.\nThat's great news for Amazon, because, as the world's leading cloud services provider, it will need to spend heavily on AI chips for years to come.\nAmazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market. That might not seem all that impressive, but consider this: Amazon's market share is roughly equal to the next two largest providers combined-- Microsoft and Alphabet.\nMoreover, the cloud infrastructure market is enormous (at around $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year. The rise of power AI systems is only adding fuel to the fire, as companies look to cloud-based AI to deliver higher sales and lower costs.\nIn short, the next phase of the AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practical AI, as companies pour resources into cloud-based, AI-enhanced systems that help their organizations' operations.\nNvidia remains the king of AI -- for now. However, as the AI revolution evolves, companies in the cloud services market could be the real winners. Furthermore, Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term.\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and data center demand, Nvidia has taken center stage in the technology sector. The company’s recent stock performance and growing market dominance have raised a critical question: Will Nvidia stock cross the $200 mark again and stay there?\nThis article explores recent developments, financial trends, technology breakthroughs, and future possibilities to offer a detailed opinion-based outlook.\nNvidia's stock has gone through a dramatic ride in recent years. From a strong rally during the AI boom in 2023 and early 2024, to a sharp pullback due to regulatory concerns and global tech volatility in late 2024, Nvidia has experienced both euphoria and correction.\nIn February 2024, Nvidia stock touched a peak near $333, powered by growing interest in AI chips.\nBy November 2024, the stock pulled back to around $150, triggered by broader tech sector weakness and export restrictions affecting GPU shipments to China.\nAs of June 2025, Nvidia trades between $190 and $205, showing signs of consolidation with strong investor interest but cautious sentiment.\nThe $200 level has become a psychological mark. Traders are watching whether Nvidia can break past it and maintain momentum.\nNvidia’s GPUs are the foundation of AI infrastructure around the world. Major tech companies use Nvidia chips to train and run large language models, machine learning systems, and deep learning algorithms. The latest chips, H100 and H200 Blackwell, are known for their processing speed and efficiency.\nAI models like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta's LLaMA all rely heavily on Nvidia hardware. Demand for these chips continues to rise, especially from cloud companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.\nThis strong position in AI computing gives Nvidia a clear edge over competitors.\nData centers are now Nvidia’s largest source of revenue. In the last quarter, data center revenue grew by over 60% year-on-year, reaching more than $14 billion. With businesses across industries adopting AI-driven analytics and automation, Nvidia’s chips are in constant demand.\nThis shift away from gaming revenue toward enterprise-level solutions has made Nvidia more stable and future-ready.\nNvidia is not just a hardware company anymore. It is building a software ecosystem that complements its hardware. Platforms like CUDA, Omniverse, Metropolis, and DGX Cloud allow developers and businesses to build AI solutions more easily.\nThese software products bring higher profit margins and recurring revenue, an important factor for long-term stock performance.\nNvidia’s push into the automotive industry with its DRIVE platform has opened new markets. Partnerships with car manufacturers for autonomous driving technology show the company’s broader ambitions beyond data centers.\nThis diversification reduces risk and expands Nvidia’s revenue opportunities over the next decade.\nAlso Read - 3 Powerful Reasons NVIDIA Remains a Must-Have Stock in 2025\nSeveral recent updates have influenced Nvidia’s stock behavior:\nThe launch of the H200 Blackwell GPU, which offers better power efficiency and performance, has strengthened Nvidia’s product leadership.\nOngoing US export restrictions on advanced chips to China have created uncertainty in Nvidia’s revenue projections. China has been a significant market for Nvidia, and tighter controls may limit sales growth.\nIncreased interest from institutional investors shows that large funds still see Nvidia as a long-term winner.\nAMD and Intel have ramped up competition, with new AI-focused chips expected to launch in the second half of 2025.\nThese developments paint a mixed picture, strong innovation and demand on one hand, and regulatory and competitive challenges on the other.\nFrom an opinion-based perspective, Nvidia has the fundamentals, momentum, and market leadership to push past $200 and stay there. However, that outcome depends on several key factors:\nStrong earnings and forward guidance will likely be the most important triggers for a breakout. If Nvidia continues to beat expectations and deliver revenue growth across data centers and AI software, investor confidence will rise.\nFuture earnings reports will be closely watched. Any surprise in revenue or margins could easily move the stock above or below $200.\nNvidia’s stock also responds to global macroeconomic trends. Lower inflation, stable interest rates, and continued growth in tech spending support bullish sentiment. If the economy remains steady and consumer/business tech demand grows, Nvidia will benefit.\nOn the other hand, any signs of recession or aggressive interest rate hikes could lead to a broader market correction, pulling Nvidia down with it.\nNvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio remains high. The company trades at a premium compared to many tech peers. This reflects high growth expectations.\nInvestors may hesitate to push the stock much higher unless Nvidia shows that its growth can continue for years. Valuation concerns often lead to short-term pullbacks even in strong companies.\nWhile Nvidia’s future looks promising, several risks could prevent it from holding above $200 consistently:\nGeopolitical Tensions – US–China trade and technology disputes may worsen. Any fresh restrictions on chip exports could reduce Nvidia’s sales in Asia.\nCompetitive Pressure – Companies like AMD and Intel are racing to close the technology gap. Even small gains by competitors could reduce Nvidia’s market share.\nCustomer Diversification – A large portion of Nvidia’s sales comes from a few big cloud providers. If any of them reduce spending or develop in-house chips, Nvidia’s revenue growth may slow.\nMarket Volatility – External shocks, such as oil price hikes or political instability, could create temporary weakness across the entire stock market, including Nvidia.\nAlso Read - NVIDIA’s Stock Forecast: Why Analysts Are Divided on Its Future\nFrom a technical chart perspective:\nStrong resistance is seen around $210–$220, which is where sellers have entered in the past.\nSupport levels are around $180–$190. The stock has bounced back from this range several times.\nIf Nvidia breaks above $210 with high trading volume and strong earnings support, a move toward $230–$250 is possible.\nIf it falls below $180, short-term weakness may follow, especially if accompanied by negative macro headlines.\nSeveral upcoming events will decide Nvidia’s next move:\nQuarterly earnings releases for Q2 and Q3 2025\nPerformance and adoption rate of the H200 Blackwell chips\nAI spending trends from big tech firms and cloud providers\nGeopolitical developments related to US–US-China tech trade\nFederal Reserve interest rate decisions\nEach of these could push Nvidia higher or lower, depending on how market participants interpret the data.\nBased on the current growth trajectory, strong product roadmap, and global demand for AI infrastructure, Nvidia appears well-positioned to not only reach $200 but sustain levels above it. However, the journey will not be smooth. Short-term pullbacks, global uncertainties, and high valuations may create some bumps along the way.\nA consistent trend above $200 will likely require:\nMultiple quarters of strong earnings\nExpansion of its software and platform business\nLimited disruption from regulators and competitors\nContinued strength in AI and cloud spending\nThe $200 mark is not just a number; it represents investor confidence in Nvidia’s role in powering the future of computing.\nIf these conditions hold, Nvidia has the potential to become one of the most valuable companies globally, possibly joining the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon in long-term investor portfolios.\nJoin our WhatsApp Channelto get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp\nStocks\nRelated Stories\nNo stories found.\n\nFollow Us\n\nDisruptive Tech⌄\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nBig Data\nData Science\nProgramming\n\nGadgets⌄\n\nBest Laptops\nBest Smartphones\nBest Smartwatch\nBest in Tablets\n\nFinance⌄\n\nCryptocurrency\nStocks\nBlockchain\nFintech\n\nTrending⌄\n\nGenerative AI\nLLMs\nChatGPT\nBitcoin\n\nEducation⌄\n\nTop Institutes\nTop Courses\nTop Online Programs\nTop Companies\n\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nContent Licensing\nDisclaimer\nWrite for Us\nTerms & Conditions\nMedia Kit\nReports\nMagazine\n\n© Analytics Insight 2025\nResponsive Sticky Footer Banner\n===============\n\nAnalytics Insight\nwww.analyticsinsight.net \nINSTALL APP\n×",

This is thanks to the company's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the resulting explosion in earnings growth. Quarter after quarter, Nvidia's revenue has advanced in the double or triple digits and reached record levels.\nIn recent times, though, against a backdrop of import tariff uncertainties and restrictions on AI chip exports to China, investors have worried about growth ahead, which has weighed on Nvidia's stock, bringing it down 29% from the start of the year to its lowest point in April.\nToday, along with the rest of the market, Nvidia has rebounded from those lows. This comes amid optimism that the tariff picture won't be as dark as originally expected and as tech customers continue to spend big on Nvidia's products and services. Now, my prediction is that Nvidia's positive momentum may not be over, and the stock will soar in 2025 thanks to one particular number. Let's explore this further.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\nSo, first, a quick look at why Nvidia shares have skyrocketed over the past several years. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), high-powered chips with the ability to handle many tasks simultaneously. They primarily served the gaming market many years ago, but then Nvidia recognized their broad potential and expanded their use into other areas -- and AI stood out as a market where GPUs could shine.\nIn fact, GPUs are central to the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs), so these models can then go on to do their job of solving complex problems. Nvidia also built out an entire ecosystem of supporting products and services, and all of this has resulted in mind-boggling growth. In the recent fiscal year, revenue soared 114% to $130 billion.\nThis continued into the recent quarter, and the earnings numbers have proven that Nvidia's customers continue to pour investments into the company's products. Revenue advanced 69% to $44 billion during the period, and Nvidia noted a significant increase in demand for inference -- the \"thinking\" process LLMs go through to tackle questions and problems.\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%) -$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nYTD \n+2.66% \n1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y\nPrice  VS S&P \nNVDA  S&P \nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nDay's Range\n$140.86 - $143.57\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $153.13\nVolume\n180,820,565\nAvg Vol\n257,480,363\nGross Margin\n70.11%\nDividend Yield\n0.03%\nDemand from major customers\nReports from Nvidia customers, such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, support this positive earnings trend we saw in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter. These players have said in recent times that AI remains a priority, and they will continue to invest significantly in it -- Meta even increased its capital spending forecast for the year.\nAll of this supports the idea of Nvidia's stock market gains this year. But one number in particular should encourage investors to get in on Nvidia -- and it could help the stock soar in the months ahead. This is a number that reflects the company's high profitability on sales. I'm talking about Nvidia's gross margin. The company has maintained a gross margin above 70% in recent quarters, with it even reaching into the mid-70% range.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia predicted that first-quarter gross margin would fall to the low-70% range amid the launch of its Blackwell architecture. (Launches involve extra costs, and the Blackwell rollout is particularly complex due to all its features and that it's customizable.) In the recent quarter, Nvidia met its goal, with gross margin settling at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China.\n(If we include the impact of the charge, gross margin on a non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting process) basis was 61% and about 60% on a GAAP basis.)\nExpanding gross margin\nFrom here, Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The company says that Blackwell will drive continued progress, with forecasts of gross margin in the mid-70% range by later this year.\nSo, Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so. Of course, the company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. If this situation worsens, it could put the brakes on stock performance, at least in the near term. It will be important to watch how this story plays out.\nBut even with that challenge in mind, I remain optimistic, considering Nvidia's impressive profitability on sales over time. And the ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track. That's why I predict that, thanks to Nvidia's solid level of profitability, the stock will soar in 2025.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n17.77% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.
