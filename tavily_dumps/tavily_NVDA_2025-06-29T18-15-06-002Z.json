Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$175.78\n11.43% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $175.78.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$175.78\n11.43% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $175.78.
