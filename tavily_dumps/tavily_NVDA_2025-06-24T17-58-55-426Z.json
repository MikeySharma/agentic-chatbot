Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\\nConsensus Rating\\nModerate Buy\\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\\nSell\\n1\\nHold\\n4\\nBuy\\n37\\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \\\"Moderate Buy.\\\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\\nConsensus Price Target\\n$173.69\\n18.15% Upside\\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

Should You Buy or Sell NVDA Stock Now?\\n by Omor IE  June 23, 2025 \\n\\nShare it:\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has rallied over 52% from its trough this year back in April, but the price action has been moderating once again. It is up over 9% in the past month, but there hasn’t been much progress made in the past two weeks. Many other semiconductor stocks have also been cooling down.\\nNVDA’s current price is similar to where it plateaued in 2024 before declining amidst tariff fears. The comeback rally has mostly been sparked by another earnings beat and guidance increase by Nvidia. But now that the price is flatlining again in the $140s range, should you take profits on NVDA stock? Let’s take a look.\\n\\nThe “Beat” Has Likely Been Priced In\\nLegendary economist shares his top 2 ways to play the gold boom [Sponsored by Eagle Publishing]\\nNvidia did beat analyst estimates in Q1, but only did so due to surging revenue from the gaming segment, which rose 48% sequentially to $3.8 billion. The data center segment actually missed. The guidance of $45 billion also fell short of the $45.9 billion that was expected by Wall Street. Investors looked past it, since Nvidia explained its guidance would have been $53 billion if it weren't for restrictions on exporting to China.\\nThe stock is up 6.7% since that beat. This is pretty fair, since China-related volatility could last for a long time. No comprehensive trade treaty has been made, and chip restrictions are unlikely to be lifted.\\nWhere NVDA Stock Could Go From Here\\nBig Oil’s Big Pivot [Sponsored by Stansberry Research]\\nThe next earnings report from Nvidia will be in late August. There are no near-term catalysts in play here, so most of the price action is being dictated by the broader market. NVDA stock’s price action is likely to trend more bearish in the near term due to geopolitical volatility and the July tariff expiry getting closer.\\nI’d still buy NVDA stock if I were a long-term investor. The one-year consensus price target of $173.19 implies 20.4% upside.\\nEmail(Required) \\nPhone \\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nSubscribe\\nBy submitting your email address you're subscribing to Money Morning, a daily newsletter that delivers independent, curated insights for everyday investors and special offers from our partners.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable.

President Donald Trump said late Saturday the move was aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Investors were waiting for a potential response from Tehran.\\nLast week, Nvidia's latest business moves were in focus. The company has several moves in June to expand artificial intelligence technology centers in Europe amid itsdevelopers conference in Europe. Nvidia said it's partnering with Germany's Deutsche Telekom to create the first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers.\\nNvidia also announced deals with companies in the United Kingdom as the U.K. government looks to bulk up the country's AI capabilities.\\nThe artificial intelligence chip titan has also been stepping up its partnership with the Saudi Arabian government to build AI infrastructure since May. The company has partnered with Humain, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund focused on AI.\\nShares of Nvidia recently rose after Trump said on Truth Social that a trade deal between the U.S. and China was \\\"done,\\\" subject to his final approval alongside that of Chinese President Xi Jinping. But the stock later pulled back amid an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran.\\nMeanwhile, analysts at Jefferies recently noted that capital expenditures by Chinese AI players Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA),and Tencent (TCEHY) were up 100% from the prior year.\\nIn other recent moves, Barron's reported that Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was set to sell more than $800 million in Nvidia stock through planned transactions.\\nNvidia in late May said first-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents rose 33% from the same quarter a year ago. Sales grew 69% to $44.1 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had projected 88 cents in earnings per share on sales of $43.2 billion.\\nFocus on China H20 chips\\nNvidia is working on a new China chip, according to reports.\\nHuang told CNBC in early May that being blocked from the Chinese market would be a \\\"tremendous loss\\\" for Nvidia. He expects China's burgeoning AI market to reach $50 billion in two to three years.\\nNvidia had written off $5.5 billion after the Trump administration said the company would need a license to sell its H20 chips abroad. A nalysts believe the company may not be granted the license.\\nHuang this month said Nvidia's system would be open to other AI-chip makers to integrate their custom chips around its standard rack design for data centers.\\nU.S.-China Trade Deal\\nA recent deal between the U.S. and China to temporarily slash tariff rates on each other boosted Nvidia shares.Another factor driving optimism was the Trump administration's rescinding of a so-called AI diffusion rule related to export controls on advanced AI chips, a rule put in place by the Biden administration.\\nNvidia expects to write off another $8 billion from its China H20 chip ban in the current quarter, and predicts $45 billion in sales.\\nMeanwhile, on IBD MarketSurge, Investor's Business Daily's premium stock research platform, one chart feature turned bullish. Although the 200-day moving average has crossed above the 50-day moving average in what is known as a \\\"death cross,\\\" the 50-day moving average is beginning to slope upward for the first time this year. The move is bullish for chart setups.\\nBig Tech Confirms Huge Spending Plans\\nNvidia stock had risen above the 50-day moving average after Amazon (AMZN) released earnings results on May 1. Amazon's run-up in capital expenditures in the first quarter was largely due to demand for its artificial intelligence services.\\nAmazon's capex for the first quarter jumped to $24.3 billion from $13.9 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\\nMagnificent Seven leaders Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently reported quarterly results that beat estimates. Meta increased its capital expenditure for 2025 to support its \\\"artificial intelligence efforts.\\\"\\nAlphabet (GOOGL), an Nvidia partner, crushed estimates and maintained its $75 billion capital spending plan.\\nBut Nvidia stock in late April was given a sell rating at Seaport Research as it initiated coverage with a $100 price target. Analysts see \\\"significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems in comparison to traditional data centers.\\\" They also see the artificial intelligence spending boom slowing in 2026.\\nNvidia stock had declined following news that China's Huawei Technologies is testing a new artificial intelligence chip that could have higher capabilities than Nvidia's H100.\\nNvidia Stock: Volatility Amid Tariff Risk\\nA flurry of tariff news spurred volatility in Nvidia stock in April. Nvidia stock surged amid a historic rally when Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries. But Trump followed that up by increasing tariffs on China to 125% after that nation imposed tariffs of 84%.\\nTrump exempted semiconductor products from those steep tariffs. On Truth Social, however, he mentioned that nobody was getting \\\"off the hook.\\\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said sector tariffs on semiconductor imports would land in about a month.\\nMeanwhile, Nvidia had announced plans to make AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The company's blog says it has \\\"commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas.\\\" Mass production is expected to ramp up in 12 to 15 months.\\nThe Trump administration added several Chinese companies to an export blacklist on national security concerns. U.S. companies selling chips to those firms will need to get government approval first.\\nWon't Hurt 'In Short Term'\\nAt the GTC conference in March, Huang noted that tariffs would not hurt the company \\\"in the short term\\\" as it seeks to move more chip production to the U.S.\\nIn terms of its 12-month price performance, Nvidia has outperformed 86% of all other stocks in Investor's Business Daily's database.\\nFunds own 40% of Nvidia's outstanding shares, according to IBD MarketSurge. Going by its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C, it would seem that funds are neutral. The rating measures price and volume action over the last 13 weeks.\\nBig Techs Confirm Huge Spending Plans\\nEarlier this year, Amazon indicated it planned to increase its spending by 27% or $105 billion – mostly on AI data centers. But Alphabet topped that as the Google parent plans to increase its spending by 57% for a total of $75 billion.\\n\\\"Most AI (computing) has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future,\\\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on its fourth-quarter earnings call in February.\\nHowever, Microsoft's spending on AI data centers is set to slow next year. Microsoft announced in December that the company faced no chip supply constraints.\\n\\nView More Trump Tariffs News And Analysis\\n\\nNvidia Stock: Market Cap\\nNvidia replaced Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November, becoming the fourth Magnificent Seven stock to join the list of blue chips. The others are Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\\nThe stock has also moved ahead of tech titan Apple (AAPL) in terms of market cap.\\n\\nBest IBD 50 Stocks To Watch\\n\\nThe AI chip behemoth has a top-level Earnings Per Share Rating of 99. Further, the stock's all-around strength, or Composite Rating, sits at 97.\\nIPhone Moment Of AI\\nNvidia's graphics processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications.\\nThe company pioneered graphics processors used in such industries as health care, game machines, automobiles and robotics.\\nIn March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to CEO Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable chips paved the way for the \\\"iPhone moment of AI.\\\"\\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It had reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a NVIDIA stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Indicators\\nMoving averages are among the most popular NVIDIA stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NVDA stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NVDA is a sum of NVDA’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the NVIDIA stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for NVIDIA stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NVDA market.\\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the NVIDIA stock price.\\nHow to read NVIDIA stock charts and forecast price movements?\\nWhen making a NVIDIA stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of NVIDIA stock with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.\\nLet’s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into “candles” that give us information about NVIDIA’s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display NVDA’s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that NVIDIA reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction.\\nt’s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle – a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.\\nWhat affects the price of NVDA stock?\\nJust like with any other asset, the price action of NVIDIA stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The NVDA stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments.\\nBullish and bearish price prediction patterns\\nSome traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.\\nHere are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns:\\nHere are some common bearish candlestick patterns:\\n\\nHammer\\nBullish Engulfing\\nPiercing Line\\nMorning Star\\n\\nThree White Soldiers\\n\\nBearish Harami\\n\\nDark Cloud Cover\\nEvening Star\\nShooting Star\\nHanging Man\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Not Investment Advice\\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\\nConsensus Rating\\nModerate Buy\\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\\nSell\\n1\\nHold\\n4\\nBuy\\n37\\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \\\"Moderate Buy.\\\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\\nConsensus Price Target\\n$173.69\\n18.15% Upside\\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

Should You Buy or Sell NVDA Stock Now?\\n by Omor IE  June 23, 2025 \\n\\nShare it:\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has rallied over 52% from its trough this year back in April, but the price action has been moderating once again. It is up over 9% in the past month, but there hasn’t been much progress made in the past two weeks. Many other semiconductor stocks have also been cooling down.\\nNVDA’s current price is similar to where it plateaued in 2024 before declining amidst tariff fears. The comeback rally has mostly been sparked by another earnings beat and guidance increase by Nvidia. But now that the price is flatlining again in the $140s range, should you take profits on NVDA stock? Let’s take a look.\\n\\nThe “Beat” Has Likely Been Priced In\\nLegendary economist shares his top 2 ways to play the gold boom [Sponsored by Eagle Publishing]\\nNvidia did beat analyst estimates in Q1, but only did so due to surging revenue from the gaming segment, which rose 48% sequentially to $3.8 billion. The data center segment actually missed. The guidance of $45 billion also fell short of the $45.9 billion that was expected by Wall Street. Investors looked past it, since Nvidia explained its guidance would have been $53 billion if it weren't for restrictions on exporting to China.\\nThe stock is up 6.7% since that beat. This is pretty fair, since China-related volatility could last for a long time. No comprehensive trade treaty has been made, and chip restrictions are unlikely to be lifted.\\nWhere NVDA Stock Could Go From Here\\nBig Oil’s Big Pivot [Sponsored by Stansberry Research]\\nThe next earnings report from Nvidia will be in late August. There are no near-term catalysts in play here, so most of the price action is being dictated by the broader market. NVDA stock’s price action is likely to trend more bearish in the near term due to geopolitical volatility and the July tariff expiry getting closer.\\nI’d still buy NVDA stock if I were a long-term investor. The one-year consensus price target of $173.19 implies 20.4% upside.\\nEmail(Required) \\nPhone \\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nSubscribe\\nBy submitting your email address you're subscribing to Money Morning, a daily newsletter that delivers independent, curated insights for everyday investors and special offers from our partners.

There are no near-term catalysts in play here, so most of the price action is being dictated by the broader market. NVDA stock’s price action is likely to trend more bearish in the near term due to geopolitical volatility and the July tariff expiry getting closer.\\nI’d still buy NVDA stock if I were a long-term investor. The one-year consensus price target of $173.19 implies 20.4% upside.\\nEmail(Required) \\nPhone [...] NVDA’s current price is similar to where it plateaued in 2024 before declining amidst tariff fears. The comeback rally has mostly been sparked by another earnings beat and guidance increase by Nvidia. But now that the price is flatlining again in the $140s range, should you take profits on NVDA stock? Let’s take a look. [...] Published Time: 2025-06-23T12:58:54+00:00\\nNvidia Is Plateauing Again.

While experts acknowledge the company’s impressive earnings growth and dominant market position in the semiconductor industry, there are underlying concerns regarding valuation and future margin sustainability. Many analysts express caution due to recent volatility and external factors like trade tariffs, which could affect demand. Despite these uncertainties, the overwhelming sentiment is one of optimism for NVIDIA's long-term trajectory, driven by the anticipated rollout of new technologies and ongoing AI adoption across various sectors.\\n\\nConsensus\\nHold\\n\\nValuation\\nOvervalued\\n\\nSimilar\\nAMDL,AMD\\nPARTIAL BUY\\n NVIDIA Corporation(NVDA-Q) -------------------------- Apr 25, 2025\\nShare Watch\\nWhen DeepSeek came out, he started selling out of this position. People are selling the Mag 7, and there might be some anti-US sentiment globally. Recent charges on China, tariff concerns. At some level it becomes cheap; at 15x 2027 earnings, with 28% growth, it's gotten oversold. Blackwell chips are the catalyst.  \\nWill only work if we're still in a bull market. US administration could tip us into a recession. Risk to this name, especially with no dividend. Start picking away ~$100-104. Be an incremental purchaser of growth names for when we do come out of this darker economic time.\\nGreg Newman\\nOwned\\nUnlock Rating\\n$110.710Stock price when the opinion was issued\\n$114.32As of May 05, 2025.

Alphabet just praised its relationship with NVDA. And yet, NVDA hasn't recovered from January's DeepSeek news. He trimmed his holding, but still owns a lot of shares. However, the White House has made NVDA a political football.

Trading at ~21x PE. Really has a monopoly; AVGO may be getting close, AMD not close at all. New products coming out with Blackwell. Companies will continue to spend, if not as much. Earnings growing rapidly, great balance sheet, no debt. A chance to get a leader at a very good multiple.   \\nIf it gets into the $90s, in a couple of years you won't regret buying.

If this leads to a constitutional crisis, you will need some cash. He always believed that the President can't fire the Fed Chair. This talk and tariffs have done enormous damage to stocks. Losses could worsen if Trump keeps trashing Powell without achieving a good tariff deal. Washington is incredibly biased against Nvidia and Apple, two excellent companies. Trump is more interested in cutting off China than advancing America's interests. This makes NVDA a hard stock to own, though not as bad as Apple. Apple makes the best consumer products on Earth, and they will eventually get AI right. But Apple makes a lot of products in China. The market could get worse, but at some point the pain will get so bad that Trump will back its most punitive measures. There has to be some sanity here. A strong Apple with business in China is in America's interest, while Nvidia is worth supporting. It doesn't have to be this way.\\nJim Cramer - Mad Money\\nOwned\\nUnlock Rating\\n$96.910Stock price when the opinion was issued\\n$114.32As of May 05, 2025.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\\nConsensus Rating\\nModerate Buy\\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\\nSell\\n1\\nHold\\n4\\nBuy\\n37\\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \\\"Moderate Buy.\\\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\\nConsensus Price Target\\n$173.69\\n18.15% Upside\\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

Should You Buy or Sell NVDA Stock Now?\\n by Omor IE  June 23, 2025 \\n\\nShare it:\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has rallied over 52% from its trough this year back in April, but the price action has been moderating once again. It is up over 9% in the past month, but there hasn’t been much progress made in the past two weeks. Many other semiconductor stocks have also been cooling down.\\nNVDA’s current price is similar to where it plateaued in 2024 before declining amidst tariff fears. The comeback rally has mostly been sparked by another earnings beat and guidance increase by Nvidia. But now that the price is flatlining again in the $140s range, should you take profits on NVDA stock? Let’s take a look.\\n\\nThe “Beat” Has Likely Been Priced In\\nLegendary economist shares his top 2 ways to play the gold boom [Sponsored by Eagle Publishing]\\nNvidia did beat analyst estimates in Q1, but only did so due to surging revenue from the gaming segment, which rose 48% sequentially to $3.8 billion. The data center segment actually missed. The guidance of $45 billion also fell short of the $45.9 billion that was expected by Wall Street. Investors looked past it, since Nvidia explained its guidance would have been $53 billion if it weren't for restrictions on exporting to China.\\nThe stock is up 6.7% since that beat. This is pretty fair, since China-related volatility could last for a long time. No comprehensive trade treaty has been made, and chip restrictions are unlikely to be lifted.\\nWhere NVDA Stock Could Go From Here\\nBig Oil’s Big Pivot [Sponsored by Stansberry Research]\\nThe next earnings report from Nvidia will be in late August. There are no near-term catalysts in play here, so most of the price action is being dictated by the broader market. NVDA stock’s price action is likely to trend more bearish in the near term due to geopolitical volatility and the July tariff expiry getting closer.\\nI’d still buy NVDA stock if I were a long-term investor. The one-year consensus price target of $173.19 implies 20.4% upside.\\nEmail(Required) \\nPhone \\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nSubscribe\\nBy submitting your email address you're subscribing to Money Morning, a daily newsletter that delivers independent, curated insights for everyday investors and special offers from our partners.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account.
