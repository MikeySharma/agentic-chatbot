Learn More\nPrediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar in 2025 (and It's Due to This 1 Number)\nBy Adria Cimino – Jun 1, 2025 at 3:10PM \nKey Points\n\nNvidia stock has surged in recent years as the company led the artificial intelligence boom. \nMoving forward, one particular element in Nvidia's earnings reports should impress long-term investors. \nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now › \n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%)-$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nPrice as of June 13, 2025, 3:58 p.m. ET\nNvidia(NVDA -2.20%) has already delivered spectacular gains for investors, advancing more than 1,400% over the past five years. This is thanks to the company's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the resulting explosion in earnings growth. Quarter after quarter, Nvidia's revenue has advanced in the double or triple digits and reached record levels.\nIn recent times, though, against a backdrop of import tariff uncertainties and restrictions on AI chip exports to China, investors have worried about growth ahead, which has weighed on Nvidia's stock, bringing it down 29% from the start of the year to its lowest point in April.\nToday, along with the rest of the market, Nvidia has rebounded from those lows. This comes amid optimism that the tariff picture won't be as dark as originally expected and as tech customers continue to spend big on Nvidia's products and services. Now, my prediction is that Nvidia's positive momentum may not be over, and the stock will soar in 2025 thanks to one particular number. Let's explore this further.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\nSo, first, a quick look at why Nvidia shares have skyrocketed over the past several years. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), high-powered chips with the ability to handle many tasks simultaneously. They primarily served the gaming market many years ago, but then Nvidia recognized their broad potential and expanded their use into other areas -- and AI stood out as a market where GPUs could shine.\nIn fact, GPUs are central to the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs), so these models can then go on to do their job of solving complex problems. Nvidia also built out an entire ecosystem of supporting products and services, and all of this has resulted in mind-boggling growth. In the recent fiscal year, revenue soared 114% to $130 billion.\nThis continued into the recent quarter, and the earnings numbers have proven that Nvidia's customers continue to pour investments into the company's products. Revenue advanced 69% to $44 billion during the period, and Nvidia noted a significant increase in demand for inference -- the \"thinking\" process LLMs go through to tackle questions and problems.\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%) -$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nYTD \n+2.66% \n1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y\nPrice  VS S&P \nNVDA  S&P \nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nDay's Range\n$140.86 - $143.57\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $153.13\nVolume\n180,820,565\nAvg Vol\n257,480,363\nGross Margin\n70.11%\nDividend Yield\n0.03%\nDemand from major customers\nReports from Nvidia customers, such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, support this positive earnings trend we saw in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter. These players have said in recent times that AI remains a priority, and they will continue to invest significantly in it -- Meta even increased its capital spending forecast for the year.\nAll of this supports the idea of Nvidia's stock market gains this year. But one number in particular should encourage investors to get in on Nvidia -- and it could help the stock soar in the months ahead. This is a number that reflects the company's high profitability on sales. I'm talking about Nvidia's gross margin. The company has maintained a gross margin above 70% in recent quarters, with it even reaching into the mid-70% range.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia predicted that first-quarter gross margin would fall to the low-70% range amid the launch of its Blackwell architecture. (Launches involve extra costs, and the Blackwell rollout is particularly complex due to all its features and that it's customizable.) In the recent quarter, Nvidia met its goal, with gross margin settling at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China.\n(If we include the impact of the charge, gross margin on a non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting process) basis was 61% and about 60% on a GAAP basis.)\nExpanding gross margin\nFrom here, Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The company says that Blackwell will drive continued progress, with forecasts of gross margin in the mid-70% range by later this year.\nSo, Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so. Of course, the company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. If this situation worsens, it could put the brakes on stock performance, at least in the near term. It will be important to watch how this story plays out.\nBut even with that challenge in mind, I remain optimistic, considering Nvidia's impressive profitability on sales over time. And the ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track. That's why I predict that, thanks to Nvidia's solid level of profitability, the stock will soar in 2025.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

      "title": "With A $2 Trillion Valuation, What Are The Risks For Nvidia Stock? - Forbes",
      "rawContent": "ByTrefis Team\nWith A $2 Trillion Valuation, What Are The Risks For Nvidia Stock?\n\nByTrefis Team,\nContributor.\n\nA binary code displayed on a laptop screen and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in ... More this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on February 25, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has rallied by almost 3.3x over the past 12 months to about $790 per share, taking Nvidia’s market cap near the vaunted $2 trillion mark. There’s a lot of reason for the optimism with Nvidia stock. As the artificial intelligence arms race gathers pace, technology companies and developers scramble to buy high-end graphics units to deploy generative AI into their applications and software. Nvidia currently dominates the market for AI silicon with chips including the A100 and H100 tailor-made for AI applications. Nvidia’s earnings have also soared accordingly. The company saw revenue for Q4 FY’24 grow by 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, while net income surged to $12.3 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. Nvidia’s chips are also meaningfully ahead of rivals such as AMD and Google’s\nGOOG\n Tensor processing units in terms of performance at the moment. The company has also built an ecosystem around its AI tools, with its programming languages, and software, which are helping the company drive incremental sales and lock in customers. These software tools, coupled with higher economies of scale, are enabling the company to post record-high margins. Gross margins stood at a lofty 76% in the most recent quarter, up from about 63% in the year-ago period. Net margins stood at an incredible 55% in Q4.\nLooking at a slightly longer period, NVDA stock has seen extremely strong gains of 510% from levels of $130 in early January 2021 to around $790 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in NVDA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, AAPL, and AVGO, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\nLooking at Nvidia’s valuation, the stock now trades at about 36x consensus 2025 earnings and 29x 2026 earnings. This is not an unreasonable multiple, considering Nvidia’s heady growth. That said, there are risks as well. Firstly, the big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs.\nMoreover, competition in the market could also mount with players such as AMD investing considerably to catch up in this space given the high stakes. Additionally, big tech players such as Google, Microsoft\nMSFT\n, and Amazon\nAMZN\n are also doubling down on developing their own AI and machine learning-related silicon. This could also pose a risk for Nvidia, as the big tech players remain the company’s largest customers. Over FY’24, the company indicated that a single customer (which was not named) accounted for 13% of its overall revenue. Big tech players could eventually slow their capex on AI-related infrastructure, as they move toward a phase of figuring out how to monetize their new capabilities.\nNvidia is also not immune to the geopolitics of the chip business. Given the strategic importance of AI, the U.S. government has been regulating the sales of some key products in markets such as China and the Middle East. While Nvidia has designed chips that work around these rules, further regulations could adversely impact the company’s business. Moreover, geopolitical issues could also disrupt the company’s supply chain. At the moment the supply of Nvidia GPUs is almost entirely reliant on Taiwan-based TSMC. Taiwan has faced mounting tensions in recent years with China, which has been asserting that Taiwan is part of its territory. We value NVDA at about $731 per share, about 7% below the market price.

Quarter after quarter, Nvidia's revenue has advanced in the double or triple digits and reached record levels.\nIn recent times, though, against a backdrop of import tariff uncertainties and restrictions on AI chip exports to China, investors have worried about growth ahead, which has weighed on Nvidia's stock, bringing it down 29% from the start of the year to its lowest point in April.\nToday, along with the rest of the market, Nvidia has rebounded from those lows. This comes amid optimism that the tariff picture won't be as dark as originally expected and as tech customers continue to spend big on Nvidia's products and services. Now, my prediction is that Nvidia's positive momentum may not be over, and the stock will soar in 2025 thanks to one particular number. Let's explore this further.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\nSo, first, a quick look at why Nvidia shares have skyrocketed over the past several years. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), high-powered chips with the ability to handle many tasks simultaneously. They primarily served the gaming market many years ago, but then Nvidia recognized their broad potential and expanded their use into other areas -- and AI stood out as a market where GPUs could shine.\nIn fact, GPUs are central to the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs), so these models can then go on to do their job of solving complex problems. Nvidia also built out an entire ecosystem of supporting products and services, and all of this has resulted in mind-boggling growth. In the recent fiscal year, revenue soared 114% to $130 billion.\nThis continued into the recent quarter, and the earnings numbers have proven that Nvidia's customers continue to pour investments into the company's products. Revenue advanced 69% to $44 billion during the period, and Nvidia noted a significant increase in demand for inference -- the \"thinking\" process LLMs go through to tackle questions and problems.\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%) -$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nYTD \n+2.66% \n1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y\nPrice  VS S&P \nNVDA  S&P \nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nDay's Range\n$140.86 - $143.57\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $153.13\nVolume\n180,820,565\nAvg Vol\n257,480,363\nGross Margin\n70.11%\nDividend Yield\n0.03%\nDemand from major customers\nReports from Nvidia customers, such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, support this positive earnings trend we saw in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter. These players have said in recent times that AI remains a priority, and they will continue to invest significantly in it -- Meta even increased its capital spending forecast for the year.\nAll of this supports the idea of Nvidia's stock market gains this year. But one number in particular should encourage investors to get in on Nvidia -- and it could help the stock soar in the months ahead. This is a number that reflects the company's high profitability on sales. I'm talking about Nvidia's gross margin. The company has maintained a gross margin above 70% in recent quarters, with it even reaching into the mid-70% range.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia predicted that first-quarter gross margin would fall to the low-70% range amid the launch of its Blackwell architecture. (Launches involve extra costs, and the Blackwell rollout is particularly complex due to all its features and that it's customizable.) In the recent quarter, Nvidia met its goal, with gross margin settling at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China.\n(If we include the impact of the charge, gross margin on a non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting process) basis was 61% and about 60% on a GAAP basis.)\nExpanding gross margin\nFrom here, Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The company says that Blackwell will drive continued progress, with forecasts of gross margin in the mid-70% range by later this year.\nSo, Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so. Of course, the company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. If this situation worsens, it could put the brakes on stock performance, at least in the near term. It will be important to watch how this story plays out.\nBut even with that challenge in mind, I remain optimistic, considering Nvidia's impressive profitability on sales over time. And the ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track. That's why I predict that, thanks to Nvidia's solid level of profitability, the stock will soar in 2025.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn More\nPrediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar in 2025 (and It's Due to This 1 Number)\nBy Adria Cimino – Jun 1, 2025 at 3:10PM \nKey Points\n\nNvidia stock has surged in recent years as the company led the artificial intelligence boom. \nMoving forward, one particular element in Nvidia's earnings reports should impress long-term investors. \nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now › \n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%)-$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nPrice as of June 13, 2025, 3:58 p.m. ET\nNvidia(NVDA -2.20%) has already delivered spectacular gains for investors, advancing more than 1,400% over the past five years. This is thanks to the company's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the resulting explosion in earnings growth. Quarter after quarter, Nvidia's revenue has advanced in the double or triple digits and reached record levels.\nIn recent times, though, against a backdrop of import tariff uncertainties and restrictions on AI chip exports to China, investors have worried about growth ahead, which has weighed on Nvidia's stock, bringing it down 29% from the start of the year to its lowest point in April.\nToday, along with the rest of the market, Nvidia has rebounded from those lows. This comes amid optimism that the tariff picture won't be as dark as originally expected and as tech customers continue to spend big on Nvidia's products and services. Now, my prediction is that Nvidia's positive momentum may not be over, and the stock will soar in 2025 thanks to one particular number. Let's explore this further.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\nSo, first, a quick look at why Nvidia shares have skyrocketed over the past several years. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), high-powered chips with the ability to handle many tasks simultaneously. They primarily served the gaming market many years ago, but then Nvidia recognized their broad potential and expanded their use into other areas -- and AI stood out as a market where GPUs could shine.\nIn fact, GPUs are central to the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs), so these models can then go on to do their job of solving complex problems. Nvidia also built out an entire ecosystem of supporting products and services, and all of this has resulted in mind-boggling growth. In the recent fiscal year, revenue soared 114% to $130 billion.\nThis continued into the recent quarter, and the earnings numbers have proven that Nvidia's customers continue to pour investments into the company's products. Revenue advanced 69% to $44 billion during the period, and Nvidia noted a significant increase in demand for inference -- the \"thinking\" process LLMs go through to tackle questions and problems.\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(-2.20%) -$3.19\nCurrent Price\n$141.81\nYTD \n+2.66% \n1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y\nPrice  VS S&P \nNVDA  S&P \nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nDay's Range\n$140.86 - $143.57\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $153.13\nVolume\n180,820,565\nAvg Vol\n257,480,363\nGross Margin\n70.11%\nDividend Yield\n0.03%\nDemand from major customers\nReports from Nvidia customers, such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, support this positive earnings trend we saw in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter. These players have said in recent times that AI remains a priority, and they will continue to invest significantly in it -- Meta even increased its capital spending forecast for the year.\nAll of this supports the idea of Nvidia's stock market gains this year. But one number in particular should encourage investors to get in on Nvidia -- and it could help the stock soar in the months ahead. This is a number that reflects the company's high profitability on sales. I'm talking about Nvidia's gross margin. The company has maintained a gross margin above 70% in recent quarters, with it even reaching into the mid-70% range.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia predicted that first-quarter gross margin would fall to the low-70% range amid the launch of its Blackwell architecture. (Launches involve extra costs, and the Blackwell rollout is particularly complex due to all its features and that it's customizable.) In the recent quarter, Nvidia met its goal, with gross margin settling at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China.\n(If we include the impact of the charge, gross margin on a non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting process) basis was 61% and about 60% on a GAAP basis.)\nExpanding gross margin\nFrom here, Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The company says that Blackwell will drive continued progress, with forecasts of gross margin in the mid-70% range by later this year.\nSo, Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so. Of course, the company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. If this situation worsens, it could put the brakes on stock performance, at least in the near term. It will be important to watch how this story plays out.\nBut even with that challenge in mind, I remain optimistic, considering Nvidia's impressive profitability on sales over time. And the ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track. That's why I predict that, thanks to Nvidia's solid level of profitability, the stock will soar in 2025.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This is thanks to the company's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the resulting explosion in earnings growth. Quarter after quarter, Nvidia's revenue has advanced in the double or triple digits and reached record levels.\nIn recent times, though, against a backdrop of import tariff uncertainties and restrictions on AI chip exports to China, investors have worried about growth ahead, which has weighed on Nvidia's stock, bringing it down 29% from the start of the year to its lowest point in April.\nToday, along with the rest of the market, Nvidia has rebounded from those lows. This comes amid optimism that the tariff picture won't be as dark as originally expected and as tech customers continue to spend big on Nvidia's products and services. Now, my prediction is that Nvidia's positive momentum may not be over, and the stock will soar in 2025 thanks to one particular number. Let's explore this further.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\nSo, first, a quick look at why Nvidia shares have skyrocketed over the past several years. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), high-powered chips with the ability to handle many tasks simultaneously. They primarily served the gaming market many years ago, but then Nvidia recognized their broad potential and expanded their use into other areas -- and AI stood out as a market where GPUs could shine.\nIn fact, GPUs are central to the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs), so these models can then go on to do their job of solving complex problems. Nvidia also built out an entire ecosystem of supporting products and services, and all of this has resulted in mind-boggling growth. In the recent fiscal year, revenue soared 114% to $130 billion.\nThis continued into the recent quarter, and the earnings numbers have proven that Nvidia's customers continue to pour investments into the company's products. Revenue advanced 69% to $44 billion during the period, and Nvidia noted a significant increase in demand for inference -- the \"thinking\" process LLMs go through to tackle questions and problems.\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(2.21%) $3.18\nCurrent Price\n$147.35\nYTD \n+4.25% \n1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y\nPrice  VS S&P \nNVDA  S&P \nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$3.5T\nDay's Range\n$145.50 - $147.90\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $153.13\nVolume\n4,414,864\nAvg Vol\n249,812,821\nGross Margin\n70.11%\nDividend Yield\n0.03%\nDemand from major customers\nReports from Nvidia customers, such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, support this positive earnings trend we saw in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter. These players have said in recent times that AI remains a priority, and they will continue to invest significantly in it -- Meta even increased its capital spending forecast for the year.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is793% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to173% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now,available when you join Stock Advisor.\nSee the stocks ›\nStock Advisor returns as of June 23, 2025\nAll of this supports the idea of Nvidia's stock market gains this year. But one number in particular should encourage investors to get in on Nvidia -- and it could help the stock soar in the months ahead. This is a number that reflects the company's high profitability on sales. I'm talking about Nvidia's gross margin. The company has maintained a gross margin above 70% in recent quarters, with it even reaching into the mid-70% range.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia predicted that first-quarter gross margin would fall to the low-70% range amid the launch of its Blackwell architecture. (Launches involve extra costs, and the Blackwell rollout is particularly complex due to all its features and that it's customizable.) In the recent quarter, Nvidia met its goal, with gross margin settling at 71.3%, excluding the impact of a $1 billion charge related to chips meant for export to China.\n(If we include the impact of the charge, gross margin on a non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting process) basis was 61% and about 60% on a GAAP basis.)\nExpanding gross margin\nFrom here, Nvidia expects gross margins of 71.8% and 72% in the second quarter, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The company says that Blackwell will drive continued progress, with forecasts of gross margin in the mid-70% range by later this year.\nSo, Nvidia has delivered strong profitability and aims to continue doing so. Of course, the company still faces some headwinds, particularly U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. If this situation worsens, it could put the brakes on stock performance, at least in the near term. It will be important to watch how this story plays out.\nBut even with that challenge in mind, I remain optimistic, considering Nvidia's impressive profitability on sales over time. And the ongoing demand for its products and services should keep that momentum on track. That's why I predict that, thanks to Nvidia's solid level of profitability, the stock will soar in 2025.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "rawContent": "ByTrefis Team\nWith A $2 Trillion Valuation, What Are The Risks For Nvidia Stock?\n\nByTrefis Team,\nContributor.\n\nA binary code displayed on a laptop screen and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in ... More this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on February 25, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has rallied by almost 3.3x over the past 12 months to about $790 per share, taking Nvidia’s market cap near the vaunted $2 trillion mark. There’s a lot of reason for the optimism with Nvidia stock. As the artificial intelligence arms race gathers pace, technology companies and developers scramble to buy high-end graphics units to deploy generative AI into their applications and software. Nvidia currently dominates the market for AI silicon with chips including the A100 and H100 tailor-made for AI applications. Nvidia’s earnings have also soared accordingly. The company saw revenue for Q4 FY’24 grow by 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, while net income surged to $12.3 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. Nvidia’s chips are also meaningfully ahead of rivals such as AMD and Google’s\nGOOG\n Tensor processing units in terms of performance at the moment. The company has also built an ecosystem around its AI tools, with its programming languages, and software, which are helping the company drive incremental sales and lock in customers. These software tools, coupled with higher economies of scale, are enabling the company to post record-high margins. Gross margins stood at a lofty 76% in the most recent quarter, up from about 63% in the year-ago period. Net margins stood at an incredible 55% in Q4.\nLooking at a slightly longer period, NVDA stock has seen extremely strong gains of 510% from levels of $130 in early January 2021 to around $790 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in NVDA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, AAPL, and AVGO, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\nLooking at Nvidia’s valuation, the stock now trades at about 36x consensus 2025 earnings and 29x 2026 earnings. This is not an unreasonable multiple, considering Nvidia’s heady growth. That said, there are risks as well. Firstly, the big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs.\nMoreover, competition in the market could also mount with players such as AMD investing considerably to catch up in this space given the high stakes. Additionally, big tech players such as Google, Microsoft\nMSFT\n, and Amazon\nAMZN\n are also doubling down on developing their own AI and machine learning-related silicon. This could also pose a risk for Nvidia, as the big tech players remain the company’s largest customers. Over FY’24, the company indicated that a single customer (which was not named) accounted for 13% of its overall revenue. Big tech players could eventually slow their capex on AI-related infrastructure, as they move toward a phase of figuring out how to monetize their new capabilities.\nNvidia is also not immune to the geopolitics of the chip business. Given the strategic importance of AI, the U.S. government has been regulating the sales of some key products in markets such as China and the Middle East. While Nvidia has designed chips that work around these rules, further regulations could adversely impact the company’s business. Moreover, geopolitical issues could also disrupt the company’s supply chain. At the moment the supply of Nvidia GPUs is almost entirely reliant on Taiwan-based TSMC. Taiwan has faced mounting tensions in recent years with China, which has been asserting that Taiwan is part of its territory. We value NVDA at about $731 per share, about 7% below the market price.
