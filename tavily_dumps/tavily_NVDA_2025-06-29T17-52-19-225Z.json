Nvidia said it's partnering with Germany's Deutsche Telekom to create the first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers.\nNvidia also announced deals with companies in the United Kingdom as the U.K. government looks to bulk up the country's AI capabilities.\nThe artificial intelligence chip titan has also been stepping up its partnership with the Saudi Arabian government to build AI infrastructure since May. The company has partnered with Humain, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund focused on AI.\nShares of Nvidia recently rose after Trump said on Truth Social that a trade deal between the U.S. and China was \"done,\" subject to his final approval alongside that of Chinese President Xi Jinping. But the stock later pulled back amid an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran.\nMeanwhile, analysts at Jefferies recently noted that capital expenditures by Chinese AI players Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA),and Tencent (TCEHY) were up 100% from the prior year.\nIn other recent moves, Barron's reported that Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was set to sell more than $800 million in Nvidia stock through planned transactions.\nNvidia in late May said first-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents rose 33% from the same quarter a year ago. Sales grew 69% to $44.1 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had projected 88 cents in earnings per share on sales of $43.2 billion.\nFocus on China H20 chips\nNvidia is working on a new China chip, according to reports.\nHuang told CNBC in early May that being blocked from the Chinese market would be a \"tremendous loss\" for Nvidia. He expects China's burgeoning AI market to reach $50 billion in two to three years.\nNvidia had written off $5.5 billion after the Trump administration said the company would need a license to sell its H20 chips abroad. A nalysts believe the company may not be granted the license.\nHuang this month said Nvidia's system would be open to other AI-chip makers to integrate their custom chips around its standard rack design for data centers.\nU.S.-China Trade Deal\nA recent deal between the U.S. and China to temporarily slash tariff rates on each other boosted Nvidia shares.Another factor driving optimism was the Trump administration's rescinding of a so-called AI diffusion rule related to export controls on advanced AI chips, a rule put in place by the Biden administration.\nNvidia expects to write off another $8 billion from its China H20 chip ban in the current quarter, and predicts $45 billion in sales.\nMeanwhile, on IBD MarketSurge, Investor's Business Daily's premium stock research platform, one chart feature turned bullish. Although the 200-day moving average has crossed above the 50-day moving average in what is known as a \"death cross,\" the 50-day moving average is beginning to slope upward for the first time this year. The move is bullish for chart setups.\nBig Tech Confirms Huge Spending Plans\nNvidia stock had risen above the 50-day moving average after Amazon (AMZN) released earnings results on May 1. Amazon's run-up in capital expenditures in the first quarter was largely due to demand for its artificial intelligence services.\nAmazon's capex for the first quarter jumped to $24.3 billion from $13.9 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\nMagnificent Seven leaders Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently reported quarterly results that beat estimates. Meta increased its capital expenditure for 2025 to support its \"artificial intelligence efforts.\"\nAlphabet (GOOGL), an Nvidia partner, crushed estimates and maintained its $75 billion capital spending plan.\nBut Nvidia stock in late April was given a sell rating at Seaport Research as it initiated coverage with a $100 price target. Analysts see \"significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems in comparison to traditional data centers.\" They also see the artificial intelligence spending boom slowing in 2026.\nNvidia stock had declined following news that China's Huawei Technologies is testing a new artificial intelligence chip that could have higher capabilities than Nvidia's H100.\nNvidia Stock: Volatility Amid Tariff Risk\nA flurry of tariff news spurred volatility in Nvidia stock in April. Nvidia stock surged amid a historic rally when Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries. But Trump followed that up by increasing tariffs on China to 125% after that nation imposed tariffs of 84%.\nTrump exempted semiconductor products from those steep tariffs. On Truth Social, however, he mentioned that nobody was getting \"off the hook.\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said sector tariffs on semiconductor imports would land in about a month.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia had announced plans to make AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The company's blog says it has \"commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas.\" Mass production is expected to ramp up in 12 to 15 months.\nThe Trump administration added several Chinese companies to an export blacklist on national security concerns. U.S. companies selling chips to those firms will need to get government approval first.\nWon't Hurt 'In Short Term'\nAt the GTC conference in March, Huang noted that tariffs would not hurt the company \"in the short term\" as it seeks to move more chip production to the U.S.\nIn terms of its 12-month price performance, Nvidia has outperformed 86% of all other stocks in Investor's Business Daily's database.\nFunds own 40% of Nvidia's outstanding shares, according to IBD MarketSurge. Going by its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C-, it would seem that funds are neutral. The rating measures price and volume action over the last 13 weeks.\nBig Techs Confirm Huge Spending Plans\nEarlier this year, Amazon indicated it planned to increase its spending by 27% or $105 billion – mostly on AI data centers. But Alphabet topped that as the Google parent plans to increase its spending by 57% for a total of $75 billion.\n\"Most AI (computing) has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on its fourth-quarter earnings call in February.\nHowever, Microsoft's spending on AI data centers is set to slow next year. Microsoft announced in December that the company faced no chip supply constraints.\n\nView More Trump Tariffs News And Analysis\n\nNvidia Stock: Market Cap\nNvidia replaced Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November, becoming the fourth Magnificent Seven stock to join the list of blue chips. The others are Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nThe stock has also moved ahead of tech titan Apple (AAPL) in terms of market cap.\n\nBest IBD 50 Stocks To Watch\n\nThe AI chip behemoth has a top-level Earnings Per Share Rating of 99. Further, the stock's all-around strength, or Composite Rating, sits at 97.\nIPhone Moment Of AI\nNvidia's graphics processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications.\nThe company pioneered graphics processors used in such industries as health care, game machines, automobiles and robotics.\nIn March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to CEO Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable chips paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It had reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales. It also showed four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023.\nBut then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the seven most recent quarters.\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\nLooking at chart signals and technical measures can help investors assess whether Nvidia stock is a buy or sell now.\nNvidia is above an alternate entry at 143.44 and in a buy zone again. With the tariff pause set to end in July, investors could also wait for a proper entry at 153.13.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\nMarketSurge: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place\nThe Four Pillars Of The IBD Methodology\nRisk Management In The Stock Market: How Much Money To Invest\nRelated news\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq Nears 20,000 As Dow Posts 500-Point Gain; Powell Stands Firm On Rates (Live Coverage) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6/24/2025 The major indexes each posted gains of more than 1% Tuesday.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a NVIDIA stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Indicators\nMoving averages are among the most popular NVIDIA stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NVDA stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NVDA is a sum of NVDA’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the NVIDIA stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for NVIDIA stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NVDA market.\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the NVIDIA stock price.\nHow to read NVIDIA stock charts and forecast price movements?\nWhen making a NVIDIA stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of NVIDIA stock with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.\nLet’s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into “candles” that give us information about NVIDIA’s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display NVDA’s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that NVIDIA reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction.\nt’s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle – a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.\nWhat affects the price of NVDA stock?\nJust like with any other asset, the price action of NVIDIA stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The NVDA stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments.\nBullish and bearish price prediction patterns\nSome traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.\nHere are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns:\nHere are some common bearish candlestick patterns:\n\nHammer\nBullish Engulfing\nPiercing Line\nMorning Star\n\nThree White Soldiers\n\nBearish Harami\n\nDark Cloud Cover\nEvening Star\nShooting Star\nHanging Man\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not Investment Advice\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only.

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\nArgus•30 days ago  \n   ### Solid quarter and guidance, with China in focus\nNvidia Corp., based in Santa Clara, California, is a visual computing company with worldwide operations and markets. The company operates through two segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking. The company's four main markets are Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. In calendar 2020, Nvidia completed the acquisition of data-center connectivity leader Mellanox.\nRating  Price Target   Argus•30 days ago  \n   ### Cutting Forecasts in an Unsettled Environment We are adjusting our estimates\nCutting Forecasts in an Unsettled Environment We are adjusting our estimates of S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations for calendar 2025 and 2026 to reflect potential negative impacts on earnings from higher costs and reduced commerce. Normally, we would adjust our EPS forecasts once or perhaps twice over the course of a year. We are not sure what will happen with tariffs and White House policy, but we may need to adjust our forecasts a few more times over the remainder of 2025. For now, our EPS reductions are tweaks rather than big moves. On the upside, the first-quarter earnings season modestly outperformed our expectations, with annual EPS growth of about 14%; we had been modeling high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS growth. On the downside, where steep tariffs are scheduled and then paused or pushed out, companies are still struggling to finalize 2025 capital budgets. Major corporations have proposed a range of strategies to deal with tariffs. At either end of the spectrum, Walmart says it will pass along tariffs to its customers; and Home Depot says it will absorb the cost of tariffs. The Walmart strategy, as the company has acknowledged, could result in lost revenue as customers (particularly in the lower tiers of the economy) forego planned purchases and make do with less. The Home Depot strategy, in theory, should do a better job of protecting the revenue stream -- but inevitably will cut into margins and thus earnings. We believe most companies will strike a balance somewhere in the middle, passing along some portion and absorbing some portion of tariffs. The 'mix' of pass along and absorb likely will vary from company to company, based on a range of factors. These could include where a company sources raw materials, which regional markets are served, and which products and components are partially or fully exempt from tariffs. 2025 EPS: After a Strong 1Q, Softer in the Middle First-quarter 2025 earnings season took place amid a major shift in U.S. trade policy that drove a turbulent response in asset markets. The U.S. ended the Biden presidency era with much of the tariff architecture intact from President Trump's first term. On April 2, days before the large money center banks began the reporting season, the president unleashed his schedule of 'Liberation Day' tariffs across dozens of nations. Although the high tariff rates were proposals meant to act as negotiating tools, they sent the stock market crashing. The president's criticism of Fed Chair Jay Powell slammed the bond market and the U.S. dollar, further contributing to unease. Subsequently, certain key tariff shifts (on China, the UK, etc.) and a more conciliatory tone toward the Fed allowed the stock market to surge back to year-opening levels. Amid this turbulence, the only 'normal' thing was 1Q25 earnings season. As is common, earnings exceeded expectations; these expectations were uncommonly gloomy as the trade environment worsened. As the quarter progressed, the blended EPS growth estimates from FactSet, Refinitiv, and Bloomberg all ticked 500 to 600 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of the earnings season, as upside surprises displaced conservative estimates in the blended tally. The three EPS compiling agencies all calculated final 1Q25 EPS growth in the 13%-14% range. About 75% of companies surpassed Street expectations; early in the reporting season, that percentage was closer to 70%. On a long-term basis (past 10 years), about three-quarters of companies reporting EPS growth have surprised to the upside. Additionally, the magnitude of the EPS beat jumped meaningfully higher as the quarter progressed, to around 9%. That is better than the 7% long-term average and now also in line with the 9% intermediate-term average. First-quarter earnings growth and revenue growth were perceived as having benefited from some 'front-loading' by businesses as a way to acquire raw materials and goods inventories ahead of anticipated tariffs. We also think some consumers may have accelerated purchases of goods, particularly those made in China, with an eye to potential price hikes in coming months. We think this pulling-forward of business and consumer activity into 1Q25, along with foregone sales at companies passing along tariffs and margin hits at companies absorbing tariffs, will be felt in second-quarter earnings and to a lesser extent in third-quarter earnings. We look for a return to stronger EPS growth in 2026, assuming tariff stability, but not as strong as we had earlier modeled. Revisions to 2025 and 2026 EPS Estimates Until the final tariff schedule is established -- not just in the U.S. but among our trading partners as well -- there will be a fair amount of speculation in any single EPS estimate, much less all the estimates for the hundreds of companies in the S&P 500. Also worth keeping in mind is that tariffs are far from the only driver of revenue and earnings growth. For 2025, our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations is $270, reduced from $276. For 2026, our new estimate is $300, reduced from $307. Our new 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 12%. And our new 2026 estimate assumes EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 11%. For the middle quarters of 2025, we are using more-conservative growth assumptions for most sectors. In particular, we have reduced our 2025 growth assumptions for Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Consumer Discretionary faces the triple whammy of already-high goods inflation, the potential for further price hikes due to tariffs, and financing rates for large-ticket items that remain too high. We still look for Healthcare EPS to grow in double-digit percentages, but have cut our growth forecast nearly in half due to the potential for White House-mandated lower drug prices and pressure on insurance company earnings from elevated procedure volumes (hips, knees, etc.). Industrial earnings could be impacted by reduced foreign demand for big-ticket equipment from machine tools to excavators to commercial aircraft. Information Technology, the largest sector, faces an appropriately large basket of risks. These include on-again, off-again tariffs on smartphones, PCs, and semiconductors, and an ever-shifting web of regulation on what technology can and cannot be shipped to China. Conclusion Our 2025 EPS growth forecast is bookended by low-double-digit growth in 1Q25 and 4Q25, with mid-single-digit growth in the middle quarters of the year. We then look for more-stable but partly-subdued growth across 2026. Accordingly, our EPS growth estimates are 10% for both 2025 and 2026. Bloomberg, which compiles analyst estimates from hundreds of companies, is now forecasting that 2025 EPS growth will slip to 7.4% in 2025 before bouncing back to 13.1% in 2026. The net effect is that the Argus and Bloomberg 2026 EPS estimates are identical at a rounded $300. In offering a 'smoothed' earnings forecast, Argus is taking into account the fact that corporate America, which may seem like a set of large faceless entities, actually fights for EPS growth at a very granular level. Nearly every major company will feature several major divisions. Each division will have segments that have sub-segments, burrowing down to a final mid-level manager overseeing a dozen or so employees. In each of these tiny pieces of the whole, the manager and team are using everything they have at their disposal to find efficiencies, negotiate hard with vendors and customers, and find new incentives to drive business activity. The unheralded work of these teams, rather than the polish of the C-Suite, is why S&P 500 companies consistently beat EPS expectations by 5%-8%. In the tariff wars, new workarounds are emerging, while familiar ones are being exploited. Under the First Sale rule, the tariff is assessed on the first transaction related to finished good. With some creative freight handling, this can reduce a tariff substantially. If the White House decides to play whack-a-mole with the First Sale rule, as it did with the de minimus exemption, other workarounds are likely to pop up. The stock market is back to approximately year-opening levels, while the earnings outlook is somewhat weaker. The economic outlook remains clouded by tariffs and trade wars. In this uncertain environment, we would continue to focus on companies with strong management, blue chip finances, clear competitive advantage, and the ability to create and monetize a steady stream of new, in-demand products.\nArgus•30 days ago  \nView More\nTop Analysts: NVDA\nView More\nOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for NVDA overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn More\nBernstein 85/100\nLatest Rating\nOutperform\n\nDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of NVDA.\nLearn More\nBernstein 79/100\nLatest Rating\nOutperform\n\nPrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of NVDA.\nLearn More\nDA Davidson 98/100\nLatest Rating\nNeutral\n\nView More\nPeople Also Watch\nTSLA Tesla, Inc.\n323.63\n-1.48%\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n143.81\n+0.09%\n\nAMZN Amazon.com, Inc.\n223.30\n+2.85%\n\nMETA Meta Platforms, Inc.\n733.63\n+1.04%\n\nAAPL Apple Inc.\n201.08\n+0.04%\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yahoo.

June 27th 2025 Let's take a look at the charts uh we are in the midst of a what I would call a tenative buy signal uh becomes official uh today with a settlement above 150.34 that should be by a 1% margin of 151.84 84 Um and yes above 15313 certainly helps in that respect I do want to point out though u and there is a rising channel top at 15704 Uh there's a one-mon structure that did contain yesterday's highs And this is the point that I would like to see the market settle above today uh for uh an accelerated move into the mid70s Until then it just might play spoiler on a long-term buy signal Now the question obviously is uh if we close above all of this uh on the weekly chart 1534 15184 15313 but do not close above the rising channel top at 15704 Should we still go long i think yes you can Uh but 15704 it did contain Thursday's highs And if Friday backs off back below 15313 for instance that January all-time high and certainly back into the 15184 area 15184 is once again a 1% threshold above 150.34 That would that would sort of negate uh a long-term buy signal in itself Under that condition then there's it's more wait and see If you're wanting to go long you really have to wait it out because it hasn't set up yet And that's I'm not saying that it actually is ultimately going to either If you're finding value in this analysis it's only a glimpse of what we offer Your real trading edge starts at wicked stocks.com Each week premium members receive two high probability stock picks Each one comes with a complete trade plan including exact entry profit target stop-loss and regular updates so you can manage the trade with confidence You'll also get daily video analysis in the top traded markets the SPY the Triple Q and Nvidia highlighting the key price levels trends and trade setups we're focused on Whether you're day trading or swing trading these insights help you zero in on the highest quality opportunities with clarity Try it all free for 5 days Cancel at any time By the way 15704 that same channel top is found on the Triple Q The Triple Q is also uh in the midst of testing its four-year channel top And this this leads to my I'm going to segue into why I think you should go to wicked stocks.com and take advantage of our 5-day free trial You'll be able to see Triple Q analysis just like Nvidia analysis And if I if I were day trading uh Nvidia like I know you likely are I wouldn't uh be without uh triple Q analysis because it's such a large component of the triple Q And when you get a double signal in both and they line up nicely oftentimes it gives you more confidence Also today Friday last day of the week this is when many of the weekly uh stock picks go off so to speak In other words the signals elicit on a Friday uh typically And so this week alone we did Mobile Eye Global that is an Israeli automated driving software company doiciled in the US We also did applied materials Uh I know mobile eye is right on the edge right on the precipice of a buy signal today that becomes official today and that that stock volatility is sufficient for a 20% move in quick order like within a matter of weeks 3 to 5 weeks So check out wicked stocks.com You'll also get daily triple Q and daily spy analysis and weekly Apple stock analysis So back to Nvidia 15704 well suited for day traders Um if we push through 15704 we could see 16252 today and if we close above 15704 today we've got a series of buy signals that have elicited not only above the 15704 formation but as I said earlier above all this the 150.34 channel top the 15313 uh previous all-time high 174 and a quarter then likely within 2 to 3 months with present volatility you could make a case for 3 to 5 weeks but I think that'll back off some 174 and a quarter in reach I'll say by the end of August if we close today above not only 15313 but I really also want to see the market close above 15704 If we don't close above 15704 we can ease back into the low 150s early next week Probably would And that would be you know a bit of an aggravation for anyone who is long the market um and u you know and then of of course if we were to close back below the 150.34 formation at the end of next week that would be buy signal rejection which is essent essentially a valid sign of weakness I don't want to get too ahead of us U you know I'm just leave you in terms of the upside idea that I want to see the market close today above 15704 if we back away and close uh below 150.34 And if you're still short uh you know then stay short If we close today below 150.34 this has just been a push through long-term resistance captured some longs probably set off some uh some uh short stops u and um uh and then the market can and probably would continue south as we move through next week If we do close today below 150.34 I would actually anticipate 13411 as a likely 2 to 3 week objective on the way down next week within 3 to 5 days 14481 is likely Uh but we are above it Uh the S&P 500 futures are now above their all-time high The SPY has yet to push through its all-time high Probably will today And so it all is setting up right now for a meaningful buy signal above 15313 into the mid70s But once again these uh these you know four-week channel tops are pesky little buggers They can wind up containing buying pressures I have it just for the day but we could ease back from here And if we fall away and close below 150.34 I see no compelling reason to stay long uh Nvidia as we move not only through next week but well into July As I said a moment ago I think if we close back below 150.34 today 13411 becomes a 2 to 3 week objective So if we close below 150.34 today that is actually a go with sell signal You can play the short side in Nvidia into the mid130s and climbing You could play the short side in Nvidia into the mid 140s That would be a two to three week sorry two to three day swing trade down to 144.81 A two to three week downside swing trade to 13411 13411 a 2 and a half month channel bottom able to contain selling through all of July And from here we can round up again And yes we would have a significant sell signal into the later third quarter if we were over the coming weeks to close below 13411 But what's playing out right now is we are pushing through the rubber band is stretching if you will um above the 1534 formation above 15313 It does as as far as the weekly chart is concerned snap to the upside if we close today above 15313 and yes also at or above 15184 Sorry about that That is the um that is the 1% uh violation of 150.34 It's a threshold we find necessary for what I would call a buy signal reliability into the mid70s And I hate to mix these up but once again I'm just going to take you back to 15704 If you're long now um you want to see the market close today above 15704 If it doesn't uh then this the market's just going to test your patience next week as it would likely back off into the low 150 So there's another way of playing this right if you've not yet done anything if you're looking to go long it could be just above 15704 I think that is the clarifier If it doesn't close above 15704 the market will probably give you the opportunity early next week to bottom pick this 150.34 uh formation And yes if we then close back below it next week as I've already said uh that would should send the market south aggressively within 2 to 3 weeks to 13411 Uh I hope that all made sense I know um all this nuancing especially with the rising channel top u you know uh you either like it or you don't but there it is Um so I'm going to leave it at that Please click like share subscribe I'll be back early Monday morning We promise a 6 a.m or earlier delivery New York Eastern time uh every

comments\nTranscript:\nnvidia Microsoft those are at record highs Um Nvidia is actually up 42% since April And our next guest says the tech trade will keep working Tim Seymour is the CIO of Seymour Asset Management and a CNBC contributor Tim we've heard um you know I can't forget Larry's term term exactly but he said you know be be fearful about about these levels or something to that extent but it sounds like you see this a little bit differently Well it's it's hard to be confident about economic certainty here and so all economic skepticism concern there's a big July 9th date There's a lot of uncertainty geopolitically Uh so all this is a reason for bears to to have the positioning they do and that's that's part of this paint trade I I I don't think I think the hedge fund community has overthought this one Uh I think that the leadership from the market is undisputed and and if you look at that move in semis off that April 4th actually intraday low for for the semis it's you know over 65% as the group but it's outperformed the S&P by 27% And you're starting to get the leadership back at the same time I think what banks are doing what industrials are doing uh tell you the story of a market that is looking past economic uncertainty doesn't mean that that's not a reality for the second half of the year potentially But uh right now uh both in terms of the seasonal dynamics a weaker dollar a plunge in oil uh leaves the VIX at 16 a.5 and a lot of people that are not long this market where they want to be\n Yeah So the question too is okay the tech resurgence has been you know one for the record books and has it run its the debate in the depths of the selloff was was there going to be new leadership a lot of people thought yes the answer was no Well you've got you know meet the new boss same as the old boss Uh always great to quote the who here U but I I do think you have a dynamic where it's it's really a combination of dynamics And it's interesting to see that this is you really haven't heard any of the hyperscalers push back on their commitment to AI and AI infrastructure Meanwhile you've had both the White House and you've had the leading chip companies in the world go on their sovereign AI tour And I think the sovereigns have really trailed the private sector and means there's a lot more behind it what you're seeing you noted I mean the move in ARM the move in in AI infrastructure uh and then even moves in in companies like Oracle and the fact that Oracle's even held on to some of these gains tells you where I think the market is And AMD uh the broadening of the chip trade So it doesn't mean that there isn't some FOMO in here It doesn't mean that multiples are are are challenged but but I I look at Nvidia and that leadership looks great to me and that's a multiple that I'm comfortable with Uh at the same time I look what banks are doing Look at what industrials Industrials have led uh much of this rally all year at a time when the dollar is weaker which I think supports uh multinationals and I I think it's obviously good for uh the industrial metal trade the precious metal trade and some of those related trades\n Nvidia shares continued to edge higher Friday up 0.8% to $15631 in early trade building on a powerful run that has seen the stock surge more than 60% since early April The Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high of $157 on Friday The company's market cap currently stands at around 3.80 trillion The increase follows Nvidia's historic rise this week to overtake Microsoft as the most valuable business in the world and puts the company on course for a fifth straight daily gain A ceasefire in the Middle East a reduction in macroeconomic worries and a renewed interest by investors in advanced computing and artificial intelligence have all contributed to the chipmaker's recent surge Other stocks in the semiconductor industry also saw a surge with Marvel up 9% AMD up 12% and Broadcom up 8% over the week Earlier this year Nvidia experienced a decline as a result of the global markets being shook by President Donald Trump's extensive tariffs Since then sentiment has stabilized and risk appetite has returned thanks to a 90-day halt on the tariff deployment and expectations for trade agreements A major overhang that has pushed investors into safer assets in recent weeks has been lifted by the truce between Israel and Iran further calming markets Growing confidence that AI spending would increase has corresponded with the tech sector's recovery CEO Jensen Hang stated during Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that robotics in addition to artificial intelligence is the company's next significant growth area He determined that the most likely first large-scale commercial application would be driverless automobiles The two biggest development prospects in our organization are artificial intelligence AI and robots which together offer multi-trillion dollar prospects Hang stated Though it still only accounted for around 1% of Nvidia's overall sales the combined automotive and robots division generated $567 million in the most recent quarter a 72% year-over-year increase In the meanwhile overall income is still driven by the demand for data center GPUs Analysts predict that Nvidia will sell close to $200 billion this fiscal year up from $27 billion in fiscal 2023 and $130.5 billion the previous year citing a spike in capital expenditures by cloud providers and large tech companies on hardware designed for generative AI workloads Loop Capital increased its price target for NVIDIA on Wednesday from $175 to $250 Analyst John Donovan pointed out in a client note that GPUs and specialized AI accelerators are taking up an increasing amount of computational infrastructure a development that has the potential to drastically alter global IT spending According to Loop Capital non CPU hardware spending might increase significantly from the current 15% of global computing capacity to $2 trillion by 2day28 or up to 60% of it The business suggested that if Nvidia reaches its long-term earnings projections the company could potentially attain a $6 trillion market capitalization given its dominant position in GPU manufacturer Thomas Ali an analyst at Barclays increased his price objective for Nvidia from $170 to $200 earlier this month while keeping his rating at overweight According to Barclays Nvidia is now expected to report sales of $42 billion for the third quarter and $ 48 billion for the fourth which is higher than the about $40.8 billion and $46.2 billion consensus projections So what implications does this have for Nvidia's stock let's explore that But first a big thank you to those of you who've stuck with us this far Creating these videos takes significant effort and dedication So if you're enjoying the content please hit the like button subscribe to our channel and share your thoughts on Nvidia stock in the comments Your support truly helps us grow Now let's get back to the video\n Um when you think about the tech names are there certain names that you like that you recommend to folks what names do you recommend without a doubt Well Nvidia you know as a technician as a fundamental guy as well uh there's no better story right there than Nvidia Nvidia has been going sideways and consolidating and finally broke out I think that has a 20 to 25% upside from here Wow Um over the next six months and because when it moves it moves quickly The last two years we've had 100% gains in the stock This year we're up 15% Uh so for it to only go up 30 40% in the year Phenomenal return Not what people expect out of Nvidia But the story is there The capex spending is there And then in the mag 7 I love Amazon Amazon has another 15 points to go to get to new highs The stock has been consolidating It looks like it wants to go higher They talked about cost cutting which you know that is a fear as a human being Cost cutting is going to have an impact on the economy but it's going to help their bottom line when they bring in some more AI And then I look at old tech IBM Cisco and then of course Oracle Oracle breaking out to new highs So in the technology space those are the ones that stand out to me Coinbase I liked it last week It's gone up high That was at a record close today It's ridiculous how far it's run And I wouldn't chase it at this point but I still think over the next 6 months it's going to be higher\n So you buy it on dips i would buy it on a dip I think you could get a 10% dip very easily given the stratospheric run we've seen in the stock But Coinbase the story is there to the crypto space\n As the chipmaker recorded new highs and investors moved past their fears about China Nvidia's stock increased for the fifth day in a row on Friday The massive manufacturer of artificial intelligence chips has reclaimed its position as the most valuable corporation thanks to the increase in shares Since the stock's 52- week low in early April it has increased by 66% with its most recent market valuation of over $3.8 trillion It surpassed both Apple and Microsoft This week it increased by more than 9% According to Dan Ies an analyst at Wedbush Securities Nvidia and Microsoft are expected to surpass the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and surpass $5 trillion within the following 18 months Nvidia had a difficult start to 2025 as confidence was tempered by worries about tariffs and China's export restrictions on semiconductors The Trump government informed Nvidia earlier this year that in order to export its H20 processors to China it would require an export license The chip was released in accordance with guidelines that the Biden administration shared The rules effectively cut off sales without a grace period According to CEO Jensen Hang who expressed concerns about being shut out of the enormous $50 billion China market he claimed that if Nvidia had been able to sell chips in the second largest economy in the world its most recent quarterly performance would have been better At Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday Hang referred to robotics as the company's greatest opportunity second only to artificial intelligence Sales for the company's robotics and automotive business units were $567 million last quarter or roughly 1% of total revenues We're working toward a time when Nvidia technology can power hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles billions of robots and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories he stated To

let's dive into today's video\n Let's get back to the market at large Tech seeing some serious strength today That sector hitting a new high the NASDAQ as well Steve Kovac is here with more We know about the mega caps but it's not just those stocks Steve\n Yeah it's it's it's a lot of tech And I'll echo what Ed was saying just a few minutes ago Scott that it's like that deep seat thing never really happened or at least a lot of these AI names has sort of shrugged it off You got lots of M&A activity just optimism around the AI story Again so much more going on but not everyone is invited to the party I'll show you that in a second But look we have NASDAQ hitting new records this week on pace to close this week up more than 3% And let me give you some highlights from the MAG 7 You have Nvidia also hitting new highs following its annual shareholders meeting You had CEO Jensen Wong making these huge promises regarding AI and even beyond that robotics It's now on pace to close up more than 8% for the week Then you got Meta We have all these headlines over the last couple weeks that it's on this huge artificial intelligence hiring spree spending enormous amounts of money Now it's up 25% for the year And then some of the low lightss out of uh the big tech names we got here Apple and Tesla still sitting out underperforming their peers For Apple it's the same thing we talk about all the time Scott still has the most exposure to tariffs and did not show off any major AI breakthroughs at WWDC It's down still nearly 20% on the year And then Tesla in a bit of a sales slump We saw the firing of that one VP yesterday and then the gains from the robo taxi debut earlier this week They pretty much got erased Tesla not as bad as it was earlier this year but it's still down about 20% on the year got all\n in pre-market trading Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high The stock was trading at $156.99 at the time of writing with a little decline to $15660 Following Wednesday's record-breaking closing price of $15,431 which increased to $15459 in after hours trading there has been an increase Nvidia has served as the market's deacto spokesperson for AI investment Early in January it peaked at $153 dartine But as China's success with DeepSeek an AI business and tariff concerns grew its shares quickly fell Although the United States forbids the export of Nvidia chips to China Deepseek used them to construct its AI systems 5 days after President Trump's Liberation Day when he announced a slew of tariffs globally the stock fell as low as $862 on April 7th However it has recently regained its losses and indicated a further commitment in AI at almost twice that price However the Wall Street Journal notes that it coincides with the dollar plunging to its lowest level in 3 years due to rumors that Trump will elevate his choice for the next head of the Federal Reserve Loop Capital's decision yesterday to increase its price objective from $175 to $250 contributed to the chipmaker's recent rise In a client note Loop Capital analyst Ananda Burua said \"Our work suggests we are entering the next golden wave of Gen AI adoption and Nvidia is at the front end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand.\" As reported by Reuters Nvidia's 4% climb on Wednesday helped the NASDAQ composite which increased by 0.3% get closer to its record high Don't forget to share your thoughts and experiences in the comments below Your input helps create a more knowledgeable community where we can all learn and grow together in the world of

Nvidia said it's partnering with Germany's Deutsche Telekom to create the first industrial AI cloud for European manufacturers.\nNvidia also announced deals with companies in the United Kingdom as the U.K. government looks to bulk up the country's AI capabilities.\nThe artificial intelligence chip titan has also been stepping up its partnership with the Saudi Arabian government to build AI infrastructure since May. The company has partnered with Humain, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund focused on AI.\nShares of Nvidia recently rose after Trump said on Truth Social that a trade deal between the U.S. and China was \"done,\" subject to his final approval alongside that of Chinese President Xi Jinping. But the stock later pulled back amid an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran.\nMeanwhile, analysts at Jefferies recently noted that capital expenditures by Chinese AI players Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA),and Tencent (TCEHY) were up 100% from the prior year.\nIn other recent moves, Barron's reported that Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was set to sell more than $800 million in Nvidia stock through planned transactions.\nNvidia in late May said first-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents rose 33% from the same quarter a year ago. Sales grew 69% to $44.1 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had projected 88 cents in earnings per share on sales of $43.2 billion.\nFocus on China H20 chips\nNvidia is working on a new China chip, according to reports.\nHuang told CNBC in early May that being blocked from the Chinese market would be a \"tremendous loss\" for Nvidia. He expects China's burgeoning AI market to reach $50 billion in two to three years.\nNvidia had written off $5.5 billion after the Trump administration said the company would need a license to sell its H20 chips abroad. A nalysts believe the company may not be granted the license.\nHuang this month said Nvidia's system would be open to other AI-chip makers to integrate their custom chips around its standard rack design for data centers.\nU.S.-China Trade Deal\nA recent deal between the U.S. and China to temporarily slash tariff rates on each other boosted Nvidia shares.Another factor driving optimism was the Trump administration's rescinding of a so-called AI diffusion rule related to export controls on advanced AI chips, a rule put in place by the Biden administration.\nNvidia expects to write off another $8 billion from its China H20 chip ban in the current quarter, and predicts $45 billion in sales.\nMeanwhile, on IBD MarketSurge, Investor's Business Daily's premium stock research platform, one chart feature turned bullish. Although the 200-day moving average has crossed above the 50-day moving average in what is known as a \"death cross,\" the 50-day moving average is beginning to slope upward for the first time this year. The move is bullish for chart setups.\nBig Tech Confirms Huge Spending Plans\nNvidia stock had risen above the 50-day moving average after Amazon (AMZN) released earnings results on May 1. Amazon's run-up in capital expenditures in the first quarter was largely due to demand for its artificial intelligence services.\nAmazon's capex for the first quarter jumped to $24.3 billion from $13.9 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\nMagnificent Seven leaders Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently reported quarterly results that beat estimates. Meta increased its capital expenditure for 2025 to support its \"artificial intelligence efforts.\"\nAlphabet (GOOGL), an Nvidia partner, crushed estimates and maintained its $75 billion capital spending plan.\nBut Nvidia stock in late April was given a sell rating at Seaport Research as it initiated coverage with a $100 price target. Analysts see \"significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems in comparison to traditional data centers.\" They also see the artificial intelligence spending boom slowing in 2026.\nNvidia stock had declined following news that China's Huawei Technologies is testing a new artificial intelligence chip that could have higher capabilities than Nvidia's H100.\nNvidia Stock: Volatility Amid Tariff Risk\nA flurry of tariff news spurred volatility in Nvidia stock in April. Nvidia stock surged amid a historic rally when Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries. But Trump followed that up by increasing tariffs on China to 125% after that nation imposed tariffs of 84%.\nTrump exempted semiconductor products from those steep tariffs. On Truth Social, however, he mentioned that nobody was getting \"off the hook.\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said sector tariffs on semiconductor imports would land in about a month.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia had announced plans to make AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The company's blog says it has \"commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas.\" Mass production is expected to ramp up in 12 to 15 months.\nThe Trump administration added several Chinese companies to an export blacklist on national security concerns. U.S. companies selling chips to those firms will need to get government approval first.\nWon't Hurt 'In Short Term'\nAt the GTC conference in March, Huang noted that tariffs would not hurt the company \"in the short term\" as it seeks to move more chip production to the U.S.\nIn terms of its 12-month price performance, Nvidia has outperformed 86% of all other stocks in Investor's Business Daily's database.\nFunds own 40% of Nvidia's outstanding shares, according to IBD MarketSurge. Going by its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C-, it would seem that funds are neutral. The rating measures price and volume action over the last 13 weeks.\nBig Techs Confirm Huge Spending Plans\nEarlier this year, Amazon indicated it planned to increase its spending by 27% or $105 billion – mostly on AI data centers. But Alphabet topped that as the Google parent plans to increase its spending by 57% for a total of $75 billion.\n\"Most AI (computing) has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on its fourth-quarter earnings call in February.\nHowever, Microsoft's spending on AI data centers is set to slow next year. Microsoft announced in December that the company faced no chip supply constraints.\n\nView More Trump Tariffs News And Analysis\n\nNvidia Stock: Market Cap\nNvidia replaced Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November, becoming the fourth Magnificent Seven stock to join the list of blue chips. The others are Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nThe stock has also moved ahead of tech titan Apple (AAPL) in terms of market cap.\n\nBest IBD 50 Stocks To Watch\n\nThe AI chip behemoth has a top-level Earnings Per Share Rating of 99. Further, the stock's all-around strength, or Composite Rating, sits at 97.\nIPhone Moment Of AI\nNvidia's graphics processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications.\nThe company pioneered graphics processors used in such industries as health care, game machines, automobiles and robotics.\nIn March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to CEO Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable chips paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It had reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales. It also showed four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023.\nBut then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the seven most recent quarters.\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\nLooking at chart signals and technical measures can help investors assess whether Nvidia stock is a buy or sell now.\nNvidia is above an alternate entry at 143.44 and in a buy zone again. With the tariff pause set to end in July, investors could also wait for a proper entry at 153.13.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\nMarketSurge: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place\nThe Four Pillars Of The IBD Methodology\nRisk Management In The Stock Market: How Much Money To Invest\nRelated news\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq Nears 20,000 As Dow Posts 500-Point Gain; Powell Stands Firm On Rates (Live Coverage) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6/24/2025 The major indexes each posted gains of more than 1% Tuesday.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a NVIDIA stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Indicators\nMoving averages are among the most popular NVIDIA stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NVDA stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NVDA is a sum of NVDA’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the NVIDIA stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for NVIDIA stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NVDA market.\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the NVIDIA stock price.\nHow to read NVIDIA stock charts and forecast price movements?\nWhen making a NVIDIA stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of NVIDIA stock with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.\nLet’s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into “candles” that give us information about NVIDIA’s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display NVDA’s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that NVIDIA reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction.\nt’s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle – a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.\nWhat affects the price of NVDA stock?\nJust like with any other asset, the price action of NVIDIA stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The NVDA stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments.\nBullish and bearish price prediction patterns\nSome traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.\nHere are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns:\nHere are some common bearish candlestick patterns:\n\nHammer\nBullish Engulfing\nPiercing Line\nMorning Star\n\nThree White Soldiers\n\nBearish Harami\n\nDark Cloud Cover\nEvening Star\nShooting Star\nHanging Man\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not Investment Advice\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only.

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\nArgus•30 days ago  \n   ### Solid quarter and guidance, with China in focus\nNvidia Corp., based in Santa Clara, California, is a visual computing company with worldwide operations and markets.

Normally, we would adjust our EPS forecasts once or perhaps twice over the course of a year. We are not sure what will happen with tariffs and White House policy, but we may need to adjust our forecasts a few more times over the remainder of 2025. For now, our EPS reductions are tweaks rather than big moves. On the upside, the first-quarter earnings season modestly outperformed our expectations, with annual EPS growth of about 14%; we had been modeling high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS growth. On the downside, where steep tariffs are scheduled and then paused or pushed out, companies are still struggling to finalize 2025 capital budgets. Major corporations have proposed a range of strategies to deal with tariffs. At either end of the spectrum, Walmart says it will pass along tariffs to its customers; and Home Depot says it will absorb the cost of tariffs. The Walmart strategy, as the company has acknowledged, could result in lost revenue as customers (particularly in the lower tiers of the economy) forego planned purchases and make do with less. The Home Depot strategy, in theory, should do a better job of protecting the revenue stream -- but inevitably will cut into margins and thus earnings. We believe most companies will strike a balance somewhere in the middle, passing along some portion and absorbing some portion of tariffs. The 'mix' of pass along and absorb likely will vary from company to company, based on a range of factors. These could include where a company sources raw materials, which regional markets are served, and which products and components are partially or fully exempt from tariffs. 2025 EPS: After a Strong 1Q, Softer in the Middle First-quarter 2025 earnings season took place amid a major shift in U.S. trade policy that drove a turbulent response in asset markets. The U.S. ended the Biden presidency era with much of the tariff architecture intact from President Trump's first term. On April 2, days before the large money center banks began the reporting season, the president unleashed his schedule of 'Liberation Day' tariffs across dozens of nations. Although the high tariff rates were proposals meant to act as negotiating tools, they sent the stock market crashing. The president's criticism of Fed Chair Jay Powell slammed the bond market and the U.S. dollar, further contributing to unease. Subsequently, certain key tariff shifts (on China, the UK, etc.) and a more conciliatory tone toward the Fed allowed the stock market to surge back to year-opening levels. Amid this turbulence, the only 'normal' thing was 1Q25 earnings season. As is common, earnings exceeded expectations; these expectations were uncommonly gloomy as the trade environment worsened. As the quarter progressed, the blended EPS growth estimates from FactSet, Refinitiv, and Bloomberg all ticked 500 to 600 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of the earnings season, as upside surprises displaced conservative estimates in the blended tally. The three EPS compiling agencies all calculated final 1Q25 EPS growth in the 13%-14% range. About 75% of companies surpassed Street expectations; early in the reporting season, that percentage was closer to 70%. On a long-term basis (past 10 years), about three-quarters of companies reporting EPS growth have surprised to the upside. Additionally, the magnitude of the EPS beat jumped meaningfully higher as the quarter progressed, to around 9%. That is better than the 7% long-term average and now also in line with the 9% intermediate-term average. First-quarter earnings growth and revenue growth were perceived as having benefited from some 'front-loading' by businesses as a way to acquire raw materials and goods inventories ahead of anticipated tariffs. We also think some consumers may have accelerated purchases of goods, particularly those made in China, with an eye to potential price hikes in coming months. We think this pulling-forward of business and consumer activity into 1Q25, along with foregone sales at companies passing along tariffs and margin hits at companies absorbing tariffs, will be felt in second-quarter earnings and to a lesser extent in third-quarter earnings. We look for a return to stronger EPS growth in 2026, assuming tariff stability, but not as strong as we had earlier modeled. Revisions to 2025 and 2026 EPS Estimates Until the final tariff schedule is established -- not just in the U.S. but among our trading partners as well -- there will be a fair amount of speculation in any single EPS estimate, much less all the estimates for the hundreds of companies in the S&P 500. Also worth keeping in mind is that tariffs are far from the only driver of revenue and earnings growth. For 2025, our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations is $270, reduced from $276. For 2026, our new estimate is $300, reduced from $307. Our new 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 12%. And our new 2026 estimate assumes EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 11%. For the middle quarters of 2025, we are using more-conservative growth assumptions for most sectors. In particular, we have reduced our 2025 growth assumptions for Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Consumer Discretionary faces the triple whammy of already-high goods inflation, the potential for further price hikes due to tariffs, and financing rates for large-ticket items that remain too high. We still look for Healthcare EPS to grow in double-digit percentages, but have cut our growth forecast nearly in half due to the potential for White House-mandated lower drug prices and pressure on insurance company earnings from elevated procedure volumes (hips, knees, etc.). Industrial earnings could be impacted by reduced foreign demand for big-ticket equipment from machine tools to excavators to commercial aircraft. Information Technology, the largest sector, faces an appropriately large basket of risks. These include on-again, off-again tariffs on smartphones, PCs, and semiconductors, and an ever-shifting web of regulation on what technology can and cannot be shipped to China. Conclusion Our 2025 EPS growth forecast is bookended by low-double-digit growth in 1Q25 and 4Q25, with mid-single-digit growth in the middle quarters of the year. We then look for more-stable but partly-subdued growth across 2026. Accordingly, our EPS growth estimates are 10% for both 2025 and 2026. Bloomberg, which compiles analyst estimates from hundreds of companies, is now forecasting that 2025 EPS growth will slip to 7.4% in 2025 before bouncing back to 13.1% in 2026. The net effect is that the Argus and Bloomberg 2026 EPS estimates are identical at a rounded $300. In offering a 'smoothed' earnings forecast, Argus is taking into account the fact that corporate America, which may seem like a set of large faceless entities, actually fights for EPS growth at a very granular level. Nearly every major company will feature several major divisions. Each division will have segments that have sub-segments, burrowing down to a final mid-level manager overseeing a dozen or so employees. In each of these tiny pieces of the whole, the manager and team are using everything they have at their disposal to find efficiencies, negotiate hard with vendors and customers, and find new incentives to drive business activity. The unheralded work of these teams, rather than the polish of the C-Suite, is why S&P 500 companies consistently beat EPS expectations by 5%-8%. In the tariff wars, new workarounds are emerging, while familiar ones are being exploited. Under the First Sale rule, the tariff is assessed on the first transaction related to finished good. With some creative freight handling, this can reduce a tariff substantially. If the White House decides to play whack-a-mole with the First Sale rule, as it did with the de minimus exemption, other workarounds are likely to pop up. The stock market is back to approximately year-opening levels, while the earnings outlook is somewhat weaker. The economic outlook remains clouded by tariffs and trade wars. In this uncertain environment, we would continue to focus on companies with strong management, blue chip finances, clear competitive advantage, and the ability to create and monetize a steady stream of new, in-demand products.\nArgus•30 days ago  \nView More\nTop Analysts: NVDA\nView More\nOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for NVDA overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn More\nBernstein 85/100\nLatest Rating\nOutperform\n\nDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of NVDA.\nLearn More\nBernstein 79/100\nLatest Rating\nOutperform\n\nPrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of NVDA.\nLearn More\nDA Davidson 98/100\nLatest Rating\nNeutral\n\nView More\nPeople Also Watch\nTSLA Tesla, Inc.\n323.63\n-1.48%\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n143.81\n+0.09%\n\nAMZN Amazon.com, Inc.\n223.30\n+2.85%\n\nMETA Meta Platforms, Inc.\n733.63\n+1.04%\n\nAAPL Apple Inc.\n201.08\n+0.04%\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yahoo.

June 27th 2025 Let's take a look at the charts uh we are in the midst of a what I would call a tenative buy signal uh becomes official uh today with a settlement above 150.34 that should be by a 1% margin of 151.84 84 Um and yes above 15313 certainly helps in that respect I do want to point out though u and there is a rising channel top at 15704 Uh there's a one-mon structure that did contain yesterday's highs And this is the point that I would like to see the market settle above today uh for uh an accelerated move into the mid70s Until then it just might play spoiler on a long-term buy signal Now the question obviously is uh if we close above all of this uh on the weekly chart 1534 15184 15313 but do not close above the rising channel top at 15704 Should we still go long i think yes you can Uh but 15704 it did contain Thursday's highs And if Friday backs off back below 15313 for instance that January all-time high and certainly back into the 15184 area 15184 is once again a 1% threshold above 150.34 That would that would sort of negate uh a long-term buy signal in itself Under that condition then there's it's more wait and see If you're wanting to go long you really have to wait it out because it hasn't set up yet And that's I'm not saying that it actually is ultimately going to either If you're finding value in this analysis it's only a glimpse of what we offer Your real trading edge starts at wicked stocks.com Each week premium members receive two high probability stock picks Each one comes with a complete trade plan including exact entry profit target stop-loss

and trade setups we're focused on Whether you're day trading or swing trading these insights help you zero in on the highest quality opportunities with clarity Try it all free for 5 days Cancel at any time By the way 15704 that same channel top is found on the Triple Q The Triple Q is also uh in the midst of testing its four-year channel top And this this leads to my I'm going to segue into why I think you should go to wicked stocks.com and take advantage of our 5-day free trial You'll be able to see Triple Q analysis just like Nvidia analysis And if I if I were day trading uh Nvidia like I know you likely are I wouldn't uh be without uh triple Q analysis because it's such a large component of the triple Q And when you get a double signal in both and they line up nicely oftentimes it gives you more confidence Also today Friday last day of the week this is when many of the weekly uh stock picks go off so to speak In other words the signals elicit on a Friday uh typically And so this week alone we did Mobile Eye Global that is an Israeli automated driving software company doiciled in the US We also did applied materials Uh I know mobile eye is right on the edge right on the precipice of a buy signal today that becomes official today and that that stock volatility is sufficient for a 20% move in quick order like within a matter of weeks 3 to 5 weeks So check out wicked stocks.com You'll also get daily triple Q and daily spy analysis and weekly Apple stock analysis So back to Nvidia 15704 well suited for day traders Um if we push through 15704 we could see 16252 today and if we close above 15704 today we've got a series of buy signals that have elicited not only above the 15704 formation but as I said earlier above all this the 150.34 channel top the 15313 uh previous all-time high 174 and a quarter then likely within 2 to 3 months with present volatility you could make a case for 3 to 5 weeks but I think that'll back off some 174 and a quarter in reach I'll say by the end of August if we close today above not only 15313 but I really also want to see the market close above 15704 If we don't close above 15704 we can ease back into the low 150s early next week Probably would And that would be you know a bit of an aggravation for anyone who is long the market um and u you know and then of of course if we were to close back below the 150.34 formation at the end of next week that would be buy signal rejection which is essent essentially a valid sign of weakness I don't want to get too ahead of us U you know I'm just leave you in terms of the upside idea that I want to see the market close today above 15704 if we back away and close uh below 150.34 And if you're still short uh you know then stay short If we close today below 150.34 this has just been a push through long-term resistance captured some longs probably set off some uh some uh short stops u and um uh and then the market can and probably would continue south as we move through next week If we do close today below 150.34 I would actually anticipate 13411 as a likely 2 to 3 week objective on the way down next week within 3 to 5 days 14481 is likely Uh but we are above it Uh the S&P 500 futures are now above their all-time high The SPY has yet to push through its all-time high Probably will today And so it all is setting up right now for a meaningful buy signal above 15313 into the mid70s But once again these uh these you know four-week channel tops are pesky little buggers They can wind up containing buying pressures I have it just for the day but we could ease back from here And if we fall away and close below 150.34 I see no compelling reason to stay long uh Nvidia as we move not only through next week but well into July As I said a moment ago I think if we close back below 150.34 today 13411 becomes a 2 to 3 week objective So if we close below 150.34 today that is actually a go with sell signal You can play the short side in Nvidia into the mid130s and climbing You could play the short side in Nvidia into the mid 140s That would be a two to three week sorry two to three day swing trade down to 144.81 A two to three week downside swing trade to 13411 13411 a 2 and a half month channel bottom able to contain selling through all of July And from here we can round up again And yes we would have a significant sell signal into the later third quarter if we were over the coming weeks to close below 13411 But what's playing out right now is we are pushing through the rubber band is stretching if you will um above the 1534 formation above 15313 It does as as far as the weekly chart is concerned snap to the upside if we close today above 15313 and yes also at or above 15184 Sorry about that That is the um that is the 1% uh violation of 150.34 It's a threshold we find necessary for what I would call a buy signal reliability into the mid70s And I hate to mix these up but once again I'm just going to take you back to 15704 If you're long now um you want to see the market close today above 15704 If it doesn't uh then this the market's just going to test your patience next week as it would likely back off into the low 150 So there's another way of playing this right if you've not yet done anything if you're looking to go long it could be just above 15704 I think that is the clarifier If it doesn't close above 15704 the market will probably give you the opportunity early next week to bottom pick this 150.34 uh formation And yes if we then close back below it next week as I've already said uh that would should send the market south aggressively within 2 to 3 weeks to 13411 Uh I hope that all made sense I know um all this nuancing especially with the rising channel top u you know uh you either like it or you don't but there it is Um so I'm going to leave it at that Please click like share subscribe I'll be back early Monday morning We promise a 6 a.m or earlier delivery New York Eastern time uh every

comments\nTranscript:\nnvidia Microsoft those are at record highs Um Nvidia is actually up 42% since April And our next guest says the tech trade will keep working Tim Seymour is the CIO of Seymour Asset Management and a CNBC contributor Tim we've heard um you know I can't forget Larry's term term exactly but he said you know be be fearful about about these levels or something to that extent but it sounds like you see this a little bit differently Well it's it's hard to be confident about economic certainty here and so all economic skepticism concern there's a big July 9th date There's a lot of uncertainty geopolitically Uh so all this is a reason for bears to to have the positioning they do and that's that's part of this paint trade I I I don't think I think the hedge fund community has overthought this one Uh I think that the leadership from the market is undisputed and and if you look at that move in semis off that April 4th actually intraday low for for the semis it's you know over 65% as the group but it's outperformed the S&P by 27% And you're starting to get the leadership back at the same time I think what banks are doing what industrials are doing uh tell you the story of a market that is looking past economic uncertainty doesn't mean that that's not a reality for the second half of the year potentially But uh right now uh both in terms of the seasonal dynamics a weaker dollar a plunge in oil uh leaves the VIX at 16 a.5 and a lot of people that are not long this market where they want to be\n Yeah So the question too is okay the tech resurgence has been you know one for the record books and has it run its the debate in the depths of the selloff was was there going to be new leadership a lot of people thought yes the answer was no Well you've got you know meet the new boss same as the old boss Uh always great to quote the who here U but I I do think you have a dynamic where it's it's really a combination of dynamics And it's interesting to see that this is you really haven't heard any of the hyperscalers push back on their commitment to AI and AI infrastructure Meanwhile you've had both the White House and you've had the leading chip companies in the world go on their sovereign AI tour And I think the sovereigns have really trailed the private sector and means there's a lot more behind it what you're seeing you noted I mean the move in ARM the move in in AI infrastructure uh and then even moves in in companies like Oracle and the fact that Oracle's even held on to some of these gains tells you where I think the market is And AMD uh the broadening of the chip trade So it doesn't mean that there isn't some FOMO in here It doesn't mean that multiples are are are challenged but but I I look at Nvidia and that leadership looks great to me and that's a multiple that I'm comfortable with Uh at the same time I look what banks are doing Look at what industrials Industrials have led uh much of this rally all year at a time when the dollar is weaker which I think supports uh multinationals and I I think it's obviously good for uh the industrial metal trade the precious metal trade and some of those related trades\n Nvidia shares continued to edge higher Friday up 0.8% to $15631 in early trade building on a powerful run that has seen the stock surge more than 60% since early April The Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high of $157 on Friday The company's market cap currently stands at around 3.80 trillion The increase follows Nvidia's historic rise this week to overtake Microsoft as the most valuable business in the world and puts the company on course for a fifth straight daily gain A ceasefire in the Middle East a reduction in macroeconomic worries and a renewed interest by investors in advanced computing and artificial intelligence have all contributed to the chipmaker's recent surge Other stocks in the semiconductor industry also saw a surge with Marvel up 9% AMD up 12% and Broadcom up 8% over the week Earlier this year Nvidia experienced a decline as a result of the global markets being shook by President Donald Trump's extensive tariffs Since then sentiment has stabilized and risk appetite has returned thanks to a 90-day halt on the tariff deployment and expectations for trade agreements A major overhang that has pushed investors into safer assets in recent weeks has been lifted by the truce between Israel and Iran further calming markets Growing confidence that AI spending would increase has corresponded with the tech sector's recovery CEO Jensen Hang stated during Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that robotics in addition to artificial intelligence is the company's next significant growth area He determined that the most likely first large-scale commercial application would be driverless automobiles The two biggest development prospects in our organization are artificial intelligence AI and robots which together offer multi-trillion dollar prospects Hang stated Though it still only accounted for around 1% of Nvidia's overall sales the combined automotive and robots division generated $567 million in the most recent quarter a 72% year-over-year increase In the meanwhile overall income is still driven by the demand for data center GPUs Analysts predict that Nvidia will sell close to $200 billion this fiscal year up from $27 billion in fiscal 2023 and $130.5 billion the previous year citing a spike in capital expenditures by cloud providers and large tech companies on hardware designed for generative AI workloads Loop Capital increased its price target for NVIDIA on Wednesday from $175 to $250 Analyst John Donovan pointed out in a client note that GPUs and specialized AI accelerators are taking up an increasing amount of computational infrastructure a development that has the potential to drastically alter global IT spending According to Loop Capital non CPU hardware spending might increase significantly from the current 15% of global computing capacity to $2 trillion by 2day28 or up to 60% of it The business suggested that if Nvidia reaches its long-term earnings projections the company could potentially attain a $6 trillion market capitalization given its dominant position in GPU manufacturer Thomas Ali an analyst at Barclays increased his price objective for Nvidia from $170 to $200 earlier this month while keeping his rating at overweight According to Barclays Nvidia is now expected to report sales of $42 billion for the third quarter and $ 48 billion for the fourth which is higher than the about $40.8 billion and $46.2 billion consensus projections So what implications does this have for Nvidia's stock let's explore that But first a big thank you to those of you who've stuck with us this far Creating these videos takes significant effort and dedication So if you're enjoying the content please hit the like button subscribe to our channel and share your thoughts on Nvidia stock in the comments Your support truly helps us grow Now let's get back to the video\n Um when you think about the tech names are there certain names that you like that you recommend to folks what names do you recommend without a doubt Well Nvidia you know as a technician as a fundamental guy as well uh there's no better story right there than Nvidia Nvidia has been going sideways and consolidating and finally broke out I think that has a 20 to 25% upside from here Wow Um over the next six months and because when it moves it moves quickly The last two years we've had 100% gains in the stock This year we're up 15% Uh so for it to only go up 30 40% in the year Phenomenal return Not what people expect out of Nvidia But the story is there The capex spending is there And then in the mag 7 I love Amazon Amazon has another 15 points to go to get to new highs The stock has been consolidating It looks like it wants to go higher They talked about cost cutting which you know that is a fear as a human being Cost cutting is going to have an impact on the economy but it's going to help their bottom line when they bring in some more AI And then I look at old tech IBM Cisco and then of course Oracle Oracle breaking out to new highs So in the technology space those are the ones that stand out to me Coinbase I liked it last week It's gone up high That was at a record close today It's ridiculous how far it's run And I wouldn't chase it at this point but I still think over the next 6 months it's going to be higher\n So you buy it on dips i would buy it on a dip I think you could get a 10% dip very easily given the stratospheric run we've seen in the stock But Coinbase the story is there to the crypto space\n As the chipmaker recorded new highs and investors moved past their fears about China Nvidia's stock increased for the fifth day in a row on Friday The massive manufacturer of artificial intelligence chips has reclaimed its position as the most valuable corporation thanks to the increase in shares Since the stock's 52- week low in early April it has increased by 66% with its most recent market valuation of over $3.8 trillion It surpassed both Apple and Microsoft This week it increased by more than 9% According to Dan Ies an analyst at Wedbush Securities Nvidia and Microsoft are expected to surpass the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and surpass $5 trillion within the following 18 months Nvidia had a difficult start to 2025 as confidence was tempered by worries about tariffs and China's export restrictions on semiconductors The Trump government informed Nvidia earlier this year that in order to export its H20 processors to China it would require an export license The chip was released in accordance with guidelines that the Biden administration shared The rules effectively cut off sales without a grace period According to CEO Jensen Hang who expressed concerns about being shut out of the enormous $50 billion China market he claimed that if Nvidia had been able to sell chips in the second largest economy in the world its most recent quarterly performance would have been better At Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday Hang referred to robotics as the company's greatest opportunity second only to artificial intelligence Sales for the company's robotics and automotive business units were $567 million last quarter or roughly 1% of total revenues We're working toward a time when Nvidia technology can power hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles billions of robots and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories he stated To

let's dive into today's video\n Let's get back to the market at large Tech seeing some serious strength today That sector hitting a new high the NASDAQ as well Steve Kovac is here with more We know about the mega caps but it's not just those stocks Steve\n Yeah it's it's it's a lot of tech And I'll echo what Ed was saying just a few minutes ago Scott that it's like that deep seat thing never really happened or at least a lot of these AI names has sort of shrugged it off You got lots of M&A activity just optimism around the AI story Again so much more going on but not everyone is invited to the party I'll show you that in a second But look we have NASDAQ hitting new records this week on pace to close this week up more than 3% And let me give you some highlights from the MAG 7 You have Nvidia also hitting new highs following its annual shareholders meeting You had CEO Jensen Wong making these huge promises regarding AI and even beyond that robotics It's now on pace to close up more than 8% for the week Then you got Meta We have all these headlines over the last couple weeks that it's on this huge artificial intelligence hiring spree spending enormous amounts of money Now it's up 25% for the year And then some of the low lightss out of uh the big tech names we got here Apple and Tesla still sitting out underperforming their peers For Apple it's the same thing we talk about all the time Scott still has the most exposure to tariffs and did not show off any major AI breakthroughs at WWDC It's down still nearly 20% on the year And then Tesla in a bit of a sales slump We saw the firing of that one VP yesterday and then the gains from the robo taxi debut earlier this week They pretty much got erased Tesla not as bad as it was earlier this year but it's still down about 20% on the year got all\n in pre-market trading Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high The stock was trading at $156.99 at the time of writing with a little decline to $15660 Following Wednesday's record-breaking closing price of $15,431 which increased to $15459 in after hours trading there has been an increase Nvidia has served as the market's deacto spokesperson for AI investment Early in January it peaked at $153 dartine But as China's success with DeepSeek an AI business and tariff concerns grew its shares quickly fell Although the United States forbids the export of Nvidia chips to China Deepseek used them to construct its AI systems 5 days after President Trump's Liberation Day when he announced a slew of tariffs globally the stock fell as low as $862 on April 7th However it has recently regained its losses and indicated a further commitment in AI at almost twice that price However the Wall Street Journal notes that it coincides with the dollar plunging to its lowest level in 3 years due to rumors that Trump will elevate his choice for the next head of the Federal Reserve Loop Capital's decision yesterday to increase its price objective from $175 to $250 contributed to the chipmaker's recent rise In a client note Loop Capital analyst Ananda Burua said \"Our work suggests we are entering the next golden wave of Gen AI adoption and Nvidia is at the front end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand.\" As reported by Reuters Nvidia's 4% climb on Wednesday helped the NASDAQ composite which increased by 0.3% get closer to its record high Don't forget to share your thoughts and experiences in the comments below Your input helps create a more knowledgeable community where we can all learn and grow together in the world of
