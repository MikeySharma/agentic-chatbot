Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA.

Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n18.15% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

The investment firm has a target price of $185 for NVDA stock, above the current price near $145.\nMore News from Barchart\n\nTrump Is Giving Tesla’s Robotaxis a Leg Up Ahead of June 22. Should You Buy TSLA Stock Now?\n\nDear Nvidia Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for July 16\n\nThe Trump Family Is Betting Big on Mobile Phones. Should Apple Stock Investors Be Worried?\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nNvidia’s Blackwell chips are reportedly sold out for the next year, with supply-demand imbalances expected to persist throughout 2025. This tight supply environment supports pricing power and is likely to translate into revenue growth for the coming quarters.\n\nwww.barchart.com \nThe chip maker’s technological leadership has enabled it to control over 90% of the GPU market, supplying critical hardware to tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA).\nNvidia Is Expanding in Several Growth Markets\nNvidia is at the forefront of addressing the global labor shortage crisis, with 50 million unfilled positions across the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Through a strategic partnership with Hexagon, Nvidia is enabling the development of AEON, an advanced humanoid robot designed for industrial applications.\nAEON leverages Nvidia’s robotics ecosystem. AI supercomputers train foundation models, while the Omniverse platform provides simulation environments for testing and optimization.\nFinally, robotic computers execute the models in real-world applications. This integrated approach accelerates development timelines, with AEON mastering core locomotion skills in just a few weeks.\nThe humanoid robot addresses critical industry needs, including reality capture, manipulation tasks, part inspection, and complex industrial operations.\nAnd importantly for investors, Nvidia’s innovative work in humanoid robotics is just one small piece of the pie. It also offers investors exposure to data centers, high-performance computing, sovereign AI, autonomous vehicles, gaming, and more.\nIs NVDA Stock Still Undervalued?\nAfter a pullback in 2025, Nvidia’s valuation has reset to decade-long lows relative to projected earnings. Today, the tech stock trades a 33.6x forward earnings, below its 5-year average of 49.2x.\nStory Continues\nBernstein maintains an “Outperform” rating, emphasizing that fears of the AI trade being “over” are premature. With the global AI industry expected to grow at a 42% compound annual rate over the next decade and Nvidia maintaining its technological moat, Bernstein believes the growth story remains in its infancy.\nOut of the 44 analysts covering NVDA stock, 37 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” three recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average target price for Nvidia stock is $174, indicating an upside potential of over 20%.\n\nwww.barchart.com \nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Additionally, director Stevens sold $88.36 million in NVDA stock, as noted by Investing.com on June 23, 2025. Such substantial insider sales could be perceived negatively by the market, possibly leading to short-term volatility.\nIn another significant development, China has unveiled a new chip, 'Meteor-1', aimed at rivaling NVIDIA amidst ongoing US sanctions. This was reported by Investing.com on June 24, 2025. The introduction of a competitive product from China could pose a challenge to NVIDIA's market share in the semiconductor industry, especially in regions affected by geopolitical tensions.\nFurthermore, an article from Investor's Business Daily dated June 23, 2025, highlights how AI demand from giants like NVIDIA and Meta is driving growth in data centers. This underscores NVIDIA's pivotal role in the AI sector and its potential for sustained revenue growth.\nNews Sentiment Analysis\nThe sentiment analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) news articles reveals a generally positive outlook. On June 23, 2025, the average sentiment score was 0.67 across 37 articles. Over the last week, from June 17 to June 24, 2025, the sentiment score improved to 0.77 from 285 articles, indicating a strong positive sentiment in the market.\nThis improved sentiment score correlates with NVIDIA's positive performance over the past month, where the stock delivered a return of 9.82%, significantly outperforming the S&P500 benchmark's 3.92%. The consistent positive sentiment despite news of insider selling suggests that investors remain confident in NVIDIA's long-term prospects and market position.\nOver the past four weeks, from May 27 to June 24, 2025, the average sentiment score was recorded at 0.68 from a total of 1,717 articles. This consistent positive sentiment suggests that despite some insider trading concerns, the overall perception of NVIDIA remains favorable among investors and analysts, which appears to be reflected in the stock's strong three-month performance of 22.50% compared to the S&P500's 6.56%.\nThe scoring system used ranges from -1 for negative sentiment to +1 for positive sentiment. The high average scores over different time frames reflect a robust confidence in NVIDIA's market position and future prospects, which has translated into actual market outperformance during periods of positive sentiment.\n| Sentiment Analysis |\n| --- |\n| Ticker | Name | Daily Score / No. Of Articles | Last 7 Days / No. Of Articles | Last 4 Weeks / No. Of Articles |\n| NVDA | NVIDIA | 0.67 from 37 | 0.77 from 285 | 0.68 from 1,717 |\n| Source: EOD Historical Data |\nMarket News\nRecent market news highlights several macroeconomic factors that could impact NVIDIA's stock performance. According to MarketWatch on June 24, 2025, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that tariffs are likely to increase inflation and affect economic activity. This could lead to broader market volatility, impacting technology stocks like NVIDIA. Notably, this news coincided with NVIDIA's slight weekly decline of -0.36%, suggesting potential sensitivity to macroeconomic concerns.\nAdditionally, Canada's inflation rate remained steady at 1.7% in May, as reported by CBC News. While this stability might suggest economic resilience, any changes in inflation trends could influence investor sentiment towards tech stocks sensitive to economic shifts. The stability in inflation rates may have contributed to NVIDIA's relative performance stability in recent trading.\nThe Bank of England's cautious approach to policy easing, as discussed by FXStreet, could also have implications for global financial markets and investor strategies concerning high-growth stocks like NVIDIA. This cautious monetary policy stance across major economies appears to be creating a balanced environment for NVIDIA, allowing its strong fundamentals to drive performance while macroeconomic factors remain relatively stable.\nEarnings\nNVIDIA's recent earnings report for the quarter ending April 27, 2025, showed an actual EPS of 0.81 against an estimate of 0.74, resulting in a positive surprise of 9.91%. This continues a trend of outperforming expectations, as seen in previous quarters where EPS consistently beat estimates.\nThe company's quarterly earnings growth year-over-year stands at 26.7%, reflecting strong operational performance and effective cost management. This impressive growth rate correlates with the positive news sentiment (0.68 over the past four weeks) and may be contributing to the stock's strong three-month performance of 22.50%.\nLooking ahead, the EPS estimate for the next quarter is set at 1.00, with the report date scheduled for August 27, 2025. This projected increase in earnings suggests continued confidence in NVIDIA's growth trajectory, aligning with the overwhelmingly positive analyst recommendations (58 buy/strong buy ratings).\nNVIDIA's impressive compound annual growth rates over one year (192.31%), three years (105.17%), and five years (82.06%) underscore its robust earnings momentum and potential for continued growth in the high-demand semiconductor sector. These exceptional growth rates help explain why investors remain bullish despite significant insider selling activities and geopolitical challenges like China's development of competing chips.\n\nAnalyst Recommendations\nAnalyst recommendations for NVIDIA remain overwhelmingly positive with a weighted average rating of 4.05 out of 5 as of June 1, 2025. The most popular rating among analysts is 'buy', supported by a target price forecast of 167.50 based on recent analyses.\nA total of 12 analysts recommend a 'strong buy', while 46 suggest 'buy'. Only seven analysts advise holding the stock, with minimal recommendations for selling or strong selling (one and zero respectively), indicating broad confidence in NVIDIA's market position.\nThis consensus reflects optimism about NVIDIA's strategic initiatives and its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in AI and data centers despite competitive pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. The strong analyst sentiment aligns with the positive news sentiment score of 0.77 over the past week and correlates with NVIDIA's impressive performance metrics, including a 9.82% monthly return and 22.50% three-month return, both significantly outperforming the S&P500 benchmark.\n\nRisk\n\nRisk Analytics\nNVIDIA is categorized as having a high risk level over the past year with an annualized standard deviation of 58.19%, significantly higher than the S&P500 benchmark's 19.85%. This indicates greater volatility and potential price swings in NVIDIA's stock, which correlates with the news about significant insider selling and competitive challenges from China's new chip development.\nThe expected volatility for NVIDIA is projected at 54.29%, compared to the benchmark's 17.41%, suggesting that investors should be prepared for substantial fluctuations in stock value. Despite these risks, NVIDIA's return over the past twelve months was 13.94%, outperforming the S&P500's return of 11.29%, indicating that investors are being compensated for the additional risk.\nThe Sharpe ratio for NVIDIA stands at 0.16, lower than the benchmark's 0.34, highlighting that while returns have been strong, they come with increased risk relative to the broader market. This risk profile should be considered in the context of the positive news sentiment (0.77 over the past week) and strong analyst recommendations (4.05 out of 5), suggesting that despite the volatility, market participants remain confident in NVIDIA's long-term prospects.\n\nPerformance\n| Time Period (as of 06/24/2025) | NVIDIA Return | S&P500 Return |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 Day | 0.22% | 0.96% |\n| 1 Week | -0.36% | -0.12% |\n| 1 Month | 9.82% | 3.92% |\n| 3 Months | 22.50% | 6.56% |\n| Source: Daizy Analytics |\nNVIDIA has shown strong performance over various time frames despite recent market volatility. Over the past day, NVDA returned 0.22%, underperforming the S&P500 benchmark which gained 0.96%. However, over the past month, NVIDIA delivered an impressive return of 9.82%, significantly outstripping the benchmark's return of 3.92%. This monthly outperformance correlates strongly with the improved news sentiment score of 0.77 over the past week, suggesting positive news coverage may be driving investor confidence.\nOver three months, NVIDIA's performance was particularly robust with a return of 22.50%, compared to the S&P500's gain of only 6.56%. This highlights NVIDIA's ability to capitalize on market trends and its strong positioning within the tech sector. The three-month performance period coincides with continued positive news about AI demand growth and NVIDIA's central role in powering AI infrastructure, as referenced in recent articles.\nDespite a slight weekly decline of -0.36% compared to the benchmark's -0.12%, NVIDIA's overall performance reflects its resilience and growth potential amidst challenging market conditions. This minor weekly setback occurred during the same period as news about Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's comments on tariffs potentially increasing inflation, suggesting some sensitivity to macroeconomic factors. Nevertheless, the broader performance metrics indicate that positive sentiment and strong fundamentals continue to drive NVIDIA's outperformance over longer time horizons.\n\nInfluence Map\nNVIDIA's operations are significantly influenced by its involvement in several key industries according to CityFalcon data sourced from recent news articles and company profiles. The Data Centre sector holds the highest relevance at 58%, underscoring NVIDIA's pivotal role in powering modern computing infrastructure with its GPUs and AI technologies.\nThe Integrated Circuits sector follows closely with a relevance of 40%. This area is crucial for NVIDIA as it continues to innovate in chip design and manufacturing processes to maintain its competitive edge against emerging rivals like China's Meteor-1 chip, which was recently reported in the news.\nAdditional exposure includes Electronic Components at 34% and Cloud Computing at 30%, reflecting NVIDIA's strategic focus on expanding its ecosystem through partnerships and technological advancements in these rapidly growing sectors. This diversified influence map aligns with recent news highlighting NVIDIA's central role in powering AI data centers, as mentioned in the Investor's Business Daily article, and explains why the company has maintained strong performance metrics despite challenges in specific areas.\n\nSustainability Analysis\nNVIDIA demonstrates strong sustainability credentials with carbon emissions measured at only 3.2 metric tonnes per $1 million sales, significantly lower than both the semiconductor sector average of 107.3 metric tonnes and the S&P500 benchmark of 100 metric tonnes per $1 million sales.\nHowever, as highlighted in the World Economic Forum's January 2025 white paper \"Artificial Intelligence's Energy Paradox: Balancing Challenges and Opportunities,\" NVIDIA's growing role in the AI ecosystem presents significant environmental challenges. The report notes that \"AI-related electricity consumption is expected to grow by as much as 50% annually from 2023 to 2030,\" with data centers being a primary driver of this growth. As the leading provider of AI chips and infrastructure, NVIDIA's products are at the center of this energy consumption challenge.\nThe WEF report emphasizes that \"model deployment is AI's most energy-intensive stage (accounting for approximately 60%)\" and that \"data centre consumption includes both AI and non-AI elements. AI processing, particularly for generative AI, is more energy-intensive due to large model complexity, longer training durations and substantial data processing.\" Given NVIDIA's 58% relevance to the Data Centre sector, the company faces both responsibility and opportunity in addressing these sustainability challenges.\nWhile NVIDIA's own ESG scores reflect leadership within the Information Technology sector with an overall ESG score of 10 (surpassing both sector and benchmark averages), the company's future sustainability profile will increasingly be tied to how it addresses the energy paradox identified in the WEF report. The report suggests several strategies that companies like NVIDIA could implement, including \"energy-efficient hardware (e.g. chips) and models\" that \"reduce electricity consumption throughout the AI life cycle\" - an area where NVIDIA has both expertise and influence.\nAs the WEF report concludes, \"AI's rapid expansion and increased electricity demand will likely present energy system challenges. However, the technology also brings opportunities and benefits, including enhanced renewable infrastructure, grid stability, and demand management.\" NVIDIA's sustainability journey will likely involve balancing these challenges and opportunities as AI adoption continues to accelerate.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nThis report is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice, an offer, or a solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security, investment product, or service.

As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA. Tickeron’s AI Trading Bots, including the Double Agent and Single Agent, cater to traders of all levels.

The Omniverse is being used in various fields, from architecture and engineering to entertainment, making NVIDIA a key player in developing the infrastructure for the metaverse.\nNvidia’s Virtual Reality\nIn the VR space, NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for creating high-quality virtual experiences. As VR technology continues to improve, the need for more powerful graphics processors will likely increase, boosting sales of NVIDIA’s high-end GPUs. The RTX series, known for its real-time ray tracing, is particularly suited for creating lifelike VR environments.\nWhat could we expect as an investor ?\nThe potential market for metaverse and VR technologies is huge. Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run. As these markets evolve, NVIDIA’s contributions to building metaverse infrastructure and enhancing VR capabilities may become key drivers of its stock performance.\nFor investors like us looking at NVIDIA’s long-term potential, it’s essential to keep an eye on developments in the metaverse and VR. While these sectors are filled with opportunity, their ever-changing nature also brings a degree of uncertainty. NVIDIA’s ability to seize these opportunities could shape its future market standing and stock value.\nConclusion\nLet’s conclude now what we have discussed in this article “Nvidia Stock Price Forecast for 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050” so far. We are not expecting Nvidia to rise much in 2025. As we have discussed in its historical analysis, this stock experienced a multi-bagger growth in its last 5 year term. So, in 2025, it may rise to ~ $170 which looks quite normal for a company with this kind of potential. But after 2025, when metaverse will get more light and people’s attention, it may again turn to a multi-bagger for you as we speak of 2035, 2040, 2050 and beyond.\nPlease Go through the FAQs for more clarity about this investment decision and share your thoughts/queries on this in our comments section.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n17.77% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a NVIDIA stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Indicators\nMoving averages are among the most popular NVIDIA stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for NVDA stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for NVDA is a sum of NVDA’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.\nIn addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.\n50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the NVIDIA stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for NVIDIA stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the NVDA market.\nTraders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the NVIDIA stock price.\nHow to read NVIDIA stock charts and forecast price movements?\nWhen making a NVIDIA stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of NVIDIA stock with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.\nLet’s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into “candles” that give us information about NVIDIA’s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display NVDA’s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that NVIDIA reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction.\nt’s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle – a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.\nWhat affects the price of NVDA stock?\nJust like with any other asset, the price action of NVIDIA stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The NVDA stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments.\nBullish and bearish price prediction patterns\nSome traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.\nHere are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns:\nHere are some common bearish candlestick patterns:\n\nHammer\nBullish Engulfing\nPiercing Line\nMorning Star\n\nThree White Soldiers\n\nBearish Harami\n\nDark Cloud Cover\nEvening Star\nShooting Star\nHanging Man\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not Investment Advice\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only.

These rapidly growing areas offer big opportunities for NVIDIA and could influence its stock performance and overall market value over the long term.\nNvidia’s Metaverse\nAt the heart of NVIDIA’s metaverse strategy is the Omniverse platform, a real-time 3D design and simulation tool. This platform leverages NVIDIA’s strength in graphics processing and AI to build immersive virtual worlds. The Omniverse is being used in various fields, from architecture and engineering to entertainment, making NVIDIA a key player in developing the infrastructure for the metaverse.\nNvidia’s Virtual Reality\nIn the VR space, NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for creating high-quality virtual experiences.

The RTX series, known for its real-time ray tracing, is particularly suited for creating lifelike VR environments.\nWhat could we expect as an investor ?\nThe potential market for metaverse and VR technologies is huge. Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run.
