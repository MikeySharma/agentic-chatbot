Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n17.77% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

This resurgence is driven by several key factors:\n\nAI Demand: Nvidia’s dominance in AI hardware, particularly with its Blackwell architecture and GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, has positioned it at the forefront of the AI boom.\nStrong Financials: In Q1 FY2026, Nvidia reported revenue of $44.1 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a 69% rise year-over-year. Data center revenue alone reached $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago.\nAnalyst Confidence: Jefferies added Nvidia to its list of highest-conviction stock picks, citing the upcoming ramp-up of its new Blackwell AI chips and projecting gross margins could rise to between 70% and 80% in 2025.\n\nNvidia Stock Performance: A Snapshot\nAs of June 3, 2025, Nvidia’s stock is trading at $141.79, reflecting a 3.19% increase from the previous close. The stock has seen a 24.1% rally in May alone, driven by strong earnings and positive analyst sentiment.\nAnalyst Perspectives: Bullish on Nvidia\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Nvidia’s prospects:\n\nJefferies: Maintains a Buy rating with a $185 price target, highlighting Nvidia’s strong potential in networking solutions and a smooth transition to its next-generation Rubin platform.\nMorgan Stanley: Reiterated its Overweight rating, calling Nvidia a “unique opportunity” in the semiconductor space and maintaining it as the firm’s top pick despite broader concerns about sector headwinds.\nUBS: Identified potential revenue boosts from the Stargate data center project in Texas, which could significantly benefit Nvidia.\n\nPotential Risks: What Investors Should Watch\nWhile the outlook is positive, investors should be mindful of potential challenges:\n\nGeopolitical Tensions: U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs could impact Nvidia’s operations and supply chains.\nInsider Selling: CEO Jensen Huang’s plan to sell $800 million in shares has raised questions, although it’s part of a pre-arranged plan to avoid insider trading concerns.\n\nConclusion: Is Nvidia a Buy?\nNvidia’s strong financial performance, leadership in AI technology, and positive analyst outlook make it a compelling investment.\nHowever, investors should remain vigilant about geopolitical risks and insider trading activities. Overall, Nvidia appears well-positioned for continued growth in the AI-driven future.\n\nGet the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.Sign up for our Morning Edition to start your day.

These rapidly growing areas offer big opportunities for NVIDIA and could influence its stock performance and overall market value over the long term.\nNvidia’s Metaverse\nAt the heart of NVIDIA’s metaverse strategy is the Omniverse platform, a real-time 3D design and simulation tool. This platform leverages NVIDIA’s strength in graphics processing and AI to build immersive virtual worlds. The Omniverse is being used in various fields, from architecture and engineering to entertainment, making NVIDIA a key player in developing the infrastructure for the metaverse.\nNvidia’s Virtual Reality\nIn the VR space, NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for creating high-quality virtual experiences. As VR technology continues to improve, the need for more powerful graphics processors will likely increase, boosting sales of NVIDIA’s high-end GPUs. The RTX series, known for its real-time ray tracing, is particularly suited for creating lifelike VR environments.\nWhat could we expect as an investor ?\nThe potential market for metaverse and VR technologies is huge. Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run. As these markets evolve, NVIDIA’s contributions to building metaverse infrastructure and enhancing VR capabilities may become key drivers of its stock performance.\nFor investors like us looking at NVIDIA’s long-term potential, it’s essential to keep an eye on developments in the metaverse and VR. While these sectors are filled with opportunity, their ever-changing nature also brings a degree of uncertainty.

(NASDAQ:NVDA)gained 0.57% over the last five trading sessions, continuing the recent rally that has seen the stock climb 6.40% over the past month. Year-to-date, NVDA is now up 4.24%, and over the past year the leader in chip makers has gained 22.06%. In April, as the deescalation of the U.S.-China trade war took hold, NVIDIA joined the $3 trillion market cap club, just ahead of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and just behind Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nWhen NVIDIA reported Q1 earnings, it announced revenue of $44.1 billion up 12% from Q4 2024 and up 69% year-over-year. Revenue from its data center business segment was $39.1 billion, up 10% from Q4 2024 and up 73% year-over-year. The company also had EPS of 96 cents, beating analysts’ expectations for 93 cents.\nWhile the stock is still trading lower than its six-month high, many analysts are viewing current prices as a buying opportunity. Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. The company is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Over the past five years, shares have gained more than 1,475%, and since going public, NVIDIA’s stock is up a preposterous 360,325%.\nDespite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect significant upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall St.has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years.\nKey Points in This Article:\n\nNVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers.\nBetween NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.\nIf you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change.\n\nNVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success\nUnless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits.a\nYearShare PriceRevenueNet Income\n2014$0.51$4.130$0.588\n2015$0.82$4.681$0.800\n2016$2.67$5.010$0.929\n2017$4.88$6.910$1.851\n2018$3.24$9.714$3.085\n2019$5.98$11.716$4.143\n2020$13.06$10.918$3.580\n2021$29.64$16.675$6.277\n2022$14.61$26.914$11.259\n2023$49.52$26.974$8.366\n2024$134.29$60.974$29.76\nPost-split adjusted basis\nRevenue and net income in $billions\nOver the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023.\nAs the AI lynchpin and Magnificent Seven mainstay looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall St.has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030.\nLoading stock data...\nKey Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance\n1. Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors likeAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion.\n2. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL),Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft— account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI.\n3. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, AI’s market size was $196.63 billion in 2023. But as large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where it is headed. From 2024 to 2030, the AI market is expected to grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report.\nWikimedia Commons\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025\nThe current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to Wall Street analysts, is $173.19, which represents 20.12% potential upside over the next 12 months based on today’s share price. Of the 40 analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock receives a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 35 analysts rating the stock a “Buy,” four rating it a “Hold” and one rating it a “Sell.”\nHowever, 24/7 Wall St.‘s forecast is a bit more conservative. By the end of 2025, we project shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $147.70, or 2.44% upside potential over the next 12 months based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030\nYearRevenueNet IncomeEPS\n2025$121.255$68.392$2.75\n2026$168.151$95.246$3.83\n2027$193.852$108.182$4.44\n2028$225.462$130.155$5.28\n2029$236.498$152.001$6.16\n2030$265.522$175.412$7.24\nRevenue and net income in $billions\nNVIDIA Stock Price Target 2025–2030\nBy the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall St. estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $241.23, good for a 67.32% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.\nYearPrice Target%Change From Current Price\n2025$147.70 2.44%\n2026$171.06 18.65%\n2027$200.57 39.12%\n2028$230.55 59.91%\n2029$222.95 54.64%\n2030$241.23 67.32%\nCredit Card Companies Are Doing Something Nuts (Sponsor)\nWe’ve been writing about ways to make, save, and invest money for over 20 years.

Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.\nConsensus Rating\nModerate Buy\nBased on 42 Analyst Ratings\nSell\n1\nHold\n4\nBuy\n37\nBased on 42 Wall Street analysts who have issued ratings for NVIDIA in the last 12 months, the stock has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy.\" Out of the 42 analysts, 1 has given a sell rating, 4 have given a hold rating, 34 have given a buy rating, and 3 have given a strong buy rating for NVDA.\nConsensus Price Target\n$173.69\n17.77% Upside\nAccording to the 42 analysts' twelve-month price targets for NVIDIA, the average price target is $173.69.

(NASDAQ:NVDA)gained 0.57% over the last five trading sessions, continuing the recent rally that has seen the stock climb 6.40% over the past month. Year-to-date, NVDA is now up 4.24%, and over the past year the leader in chip makers has gained 22.06%. In April, as the deescalation of the U.S.-China trade war took hold, NVIDIA joined the $3 trillion market cap club, just ahead of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and just behind Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nWhen NVIDIA reported Q1 earnings, it announced revenue of $44.1 billion up 12% from Q4 2024 and up 69% year-over-year. Revenue from its data center business segment was $39.1 billion, up 10% from Q4 2024 and up 73% year-over-year. The company also had EPS of 96 cents, beating analysts’ expectations for 93 cents.\nWhile the stock is still trading lower than its six-month high, many analysts are viewing current prices as a buying opportunity. Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. The company is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Over the past five years, shares have gained more than 1,475%, and since going public, NVIDIA’s stock is up a preposterous 360,325%.\nDespite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect significant upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall St.has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years.\nKey Points in This Article:\n\nNVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers.\nBetween NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.\nIf you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change.\n\nNVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success\nUnless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits.a\nYearShare PriceRevenueNet Income\n2014$0.51$4.130$0.588\n2015$0.82$4.681$0.800\n2016$2.67$5.010$0.929\n2017$4.88$6.910$1.851\n2018$3.24$9.714$3.085\n2019$5.98$11.716$4.143\n2020$13.06$10.918$3.580\n2021$29.64$16.675$6.277\n2022$14.61$26.914$11.259\n2023$49.52$26.974$8.366\n2024$134.29$60.974$29.76\nPost-split adjusted basis\nRevenue and net income in $billions\nOver the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023.\nAs the AI lynchpin and Magnificent Seven mainstay looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall St.has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030.\nLoading stock data...\nKey Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance\n1. Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors likeAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion.\n2. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL),Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft— account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI.\n3. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, AI’s market size was $196.63 billion in 2023. But as large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where it is headed. From 2024 to 2030, the AI market is expected to grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report.\nWikimedia Commons\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025\nThe current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to Wall Street analysts, is $173.19, which represents 20.12% potential upside over the next 12 months based on today’s share price. Of the 40 analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock receives a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 35 analysts rating the stock a “Buy,” four rating it a “Hold” and one rating it a “Sell.”\nHowever, 24/7 Wall St.‘s forecast is a bit more conservative. By the end of 2025, we project shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $147.70, or 2.44% upside potential over the next 12 months based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030\nYearRevenueNet IncomeEPS\n2025$121.255$68.392$2.75\n2026$168.151$95.246$3.83\n2027$193.852$108.182$4.44\n2028$225.462$130.155$5.28\n2029$236.498$152.001$6.16\n2030$265.522$175.412$7.24\nRevenue and net income in $billions\nNVIDIA Stock Price Target 2025–2030\nBy the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall St. estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $241.23, good for a 67.32% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA.

These rapidly growing areas offer big opportunities for NVIDIA and could influence its stock performance and overall market value over the long term.\nNvidia’s Metaverse\nAt the heart of NVIDIA’s metaverse strategy is the Omniverse platform, a real-time 3D design and simulation tool. This platform leverages NVIDIA’s strength in graphics processing and AI to build immersive virtual worlds. The Omniverse is being used in various fields, from architecture and engineering to entertainment, making NVIDIA a key player in developing the infrastructure for the metaverse.\nNvidia’s Virtual Reality\nIn the VR space, NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for creating high-quality virtual experiences.

The RTX series, known for its real-time ray tracing, is particularly suited for creating lifelike VR environments.\nWhat could we expect as an investor ?\nThe potential market for metaverse and VR technologies is huge. Some analysts predict the metaverse could be an $800 billion market by 2024 and could grow to $30 trillion by 2030. NVIDIA’s strong presence in this space could play a significant role in its future growth.\nThat said, the metaverse and VR industries are still in their early stages, and how they develop remains uncertain. Factors like user adoption, content creation, and technological hurdles could affect growth. NVIDIA also faces competition from other tech giants that are heavily investing in these areas.\nDespite these challenges, NVIDIA’s technological leadership and strategic position in the metaverse and VR could provide significant growth in the long run.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA. Tickeron’s AI Trading Bots, including the Double Agent and Single Agent, cater to traders of all levels.
