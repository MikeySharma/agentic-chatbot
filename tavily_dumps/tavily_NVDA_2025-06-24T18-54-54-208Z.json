This resurgence is driven by several key factors:\n\nAI Demand: Nvidia’s dominance in AI hardware, particularly with its Blackwell architecture and GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, has positioned it at the forefront of the AI boom.\nStrong Financials: In Q1 FY2026, Nvidia reported revenue of $44.1 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a 69% rise year-over-year. Data center revenue alone reached $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago.\nAnalyst Confidence: Jefferies added Nvidia to its list of highest-conviction stock picks, citing the upcoming ramp-up of its new Blackwell AI chips and projecting gross margins could rise to between 70% and 80% in 2025.\n\nNvidia Stock Performance: A Snapshot\nAs of June 3, 2025, Nvidia’s stock is trading at $141.79, reflecting a 3.19% increase from the previous close. The stock has seen a 24.1% rally in May alone, driven by strong earnings and positive analyst sentiment.\nAnalyst Perspectives: Bullish on Nvidia\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Nvidia’s prospects:\n\nJefferies: Maintains a Buy rating with a $185 price target, highlighting Nvidia’s strong potential in networking solutions and a smooth transition to its next-generation Rubin platform.\nMorgan Stanley: Reiterated its Overweight rating, calling Nvidia a “unique opportunity” in the semiconductor space and maintaining it as the firm’s top pick despite broader concerns about sector headwinds.\nUBS: Identified potential revenue boosts from the Stargate data center project in Texas, which could significantly benefit Nvidia.\n\nPotential Risks: What Investors Should Watch\nWhile the outlook is positive, investors should be mindful of potential challenges:\n\nGeopolitical Tensions: U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs could impact Nvidia’s operations and supply chains.\nInsider Selling: CEO Jensen Huang’s plan to sell $800 million in shares has raised questions, although it’s part of a pre-arranged plan to avoid insider trading concerns.\n\nConclusion: Is Nvidia a Buy?\nNvidia’s strong financial performance, leadership in AI technology, and positive analyst outlook make it a compelling investment.\nHowever, investors should remain vigilant about geopolitical risks and insider trading activities. Overall, Nvidia appears well-positioned for continued growth in the AI-driven future.\n\nGet the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.Sign up for our Morning Edition to start your day.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA. Tickeron’s AI Trading Bots, including the Double Agent and Single Agent, cater to traders of all levels. The NVDA Swing Trader Bot, for example, optimizes trades by factoring in AI and gaming sector trends, achieving up to 86.6% win rates in volatile markets. These bots provide real-time insights, seamless brokerage integration, and high-liquidity execution, reducing slippage and enhancing profitability. For NVDA, Tickeron’s tools have identified key patterns, such as bullish moving average crossovers and oversold conditions near the lower Bollinger Bands, enabling traders to capitalize on price movements with precision.\n\nRobot factory Trading Results for last 12 months NVDA\nAI Robots (Signal Agents)\n| AI Robot’s Name | P/L |\n| --- | --- |\n| NVDA / NVDS Trading Results AI Trading Double Agent,60min | 111.57% |\n| Swing Trader, Popular Stocks: Price Action Trading Strategy – Pro Version (TA&FA) | 17.01% |\nAI Robots (Virtual Agents)\n| AI Robot’s Name | P/L |\n| --- | --- |\n| NVDA / NVDS Trading Results AI Trading Double Agent, 60 min | 111.74% |\n| Swing Trader: Search for Dips in Top 10 Giants (TA) | 40.95% |\n| Swing Trader: Tracking Dip Trends in Industrial Stocks (TA) – Trading Results | 15.84% |\nAI Robots (Brokerage Agetns)\n\nConclusion: Navigating NVDA’s Future with AI-Driven Insights\nNVIDIA (NVDA) remains a powerhouse in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with strong fundamentals and significant growth potential as of June 16, 2025. Despite recent volatility, its 70% revenue growth, low P/E ratio, and analyst optimism signal a promising outlook. By leveraging Tickeron’s AI-powered tools, traders can navigate NVDA’s market dynamics with greater precision, utilizing strategies like the Double Agent Trading Bot to balance bullish and bearish positions with inverse ETFs like NVDS.

Should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before June 25? No -- at least, not because of the meeting. That doesn't mean scooping up shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker over the next few days is a bad move, though.\nSome corporate events can provide huge catalysts for stocks. Quarterly earnings releases are one obvious example. Major product announcements are another. Annual shareholder meeting? Not so much. However, there are other reasons you might want to buy Nvidia stock sooner rather than later.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\nWhat Nvidia plans to discuss\nFor the most part, Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting this week will probably be boring. First on the agenda is to elect the board of directors. Unless something truly shocking happens, the nominated slate of directors should be a shoo-in.\nNext up is a vote on advisory approval of executive compensation, commonly referred to as \"say-on-pay.\" This allows shareholders to voice their approval or disapproval of Nvidia's executive compensation plan for the next year. However, the vote isn't binding on the board of directors.\nMaybe the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Nvidia's independent accounting firm will excite some investors, but I doubt it. Either way, it's the next item on the agenda.\nAt last year's annual meeting, shareholders approved a nonbinding proposal requesting the board to eliminate supermajority voting provisions in Nvidia's charter and bylaws. After consideration, the board decided to recommend changing those documents. As a result, eliminating the supermajority voting provisions will be officially voted on at the upcoming meeting (and will, somewhat ironically, require a supermajority vote of 66 2/3% of shareholders to become effective).\nOn a similar note, three stockholder proposals are on the agenda this year:\nNvidia's board recommended shareholders vote against these proposals. Even if the proposals are approved, though, none would affect the stock. It's possible that something interesting could arise during the \"other matters\" part of the company's annual shareholder meeting, but I wouldn't bet on it.\nA more important upcoming event\nIf you're looking for a catalyst for Nvidia stock, you'll probably have to wait a while longer. The next scheduled event that could cause shares to rise won't be until the company reports its fiscal year 2026 second-quarter results on Aug. 27, 2025.\nHowever, it's entirely possible that this Q2 update won't move the needle much. Nvidia would need to blow past earnings estimates or reveal something else that's really positive to have a significant effect on the stock.\nWhy buy Nvidia stock sooner rather than later?\nJust because Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting will likely be a big nothingburger doesn't mean buying the stock hand over fist before June 25 is a bad idea. Actually, for long-term investors, it could be a smart move.\nFrom my perspective, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is only in its early stages, and the rise of AI agents could provide a significant tailwind for Nvidia. So could progress in developing artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nWhile I can imagine a future where Nvidia isn't at the forefront of the AI chip market, I think it's much more likely that the company will remain a key player. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is the best AI chip available. The company's roadmap of new products each year should keep Nvidia ahead of the pack.\nSure, valuation is a perennial objection to buying the stock. I've raised the question myself in the past. However, if the AI market unfolds like I suspect it will, Nvidia's growth will justify its current valuation. Investors won't miss the opportunity if they don't buy the stock before June 25. But if you believe in Nvidia's potential, there's no time like the present.\nKeith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management.

Tickeron Inc.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Market Trends, AI Insights, and Trading Strategies for June 2025\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) remains a cornerstone of the technology sector, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and data center solutions. As of June 16, 2025, NVDA continues to capture investor attention due to its pivotal role in the AI revolution and its robust financial performance. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVDA’s recent market movements, key news, correlations with other stocks, inverse ETF trading strategies, and the role of AI-driven tools from Tickeron in optimizing trading decisions. Leveraging data, statistics, and insights from Tickeron’s AI Trading Agents, this analysis offers a detailed perspective for traders and investors navigating NVDA’s dynamic market landscape.\n\nThis year, the stock gained+9.59%with an average daily volume of 274 million shares traded.The stock tracked a drawdown of-43.43%for this period.NVDA showed earnings on May 28, 2025. You can read more about the earnings reporthere.\nNVDA’s Market Performance in 2025\nNVDA has exhibited significant volatility in 2025, reflecting both its growth potential and market challenges. According to posts on X, NVDA experienced a 44% decline from a high of $153 to $86 over four months earlier in the year, yet analysts remain optimistic about its recovery. As of June 16, 2025, the stock is trading around $124, approaching a key resistance level, with some analysts projecting a potential rise to $170 or higher by year-end, driven by strong fundamentals and AI demand. NVIDIA’s revenue grew by 70% year-over-year, with free cash flow increasing by 125%, despite trading at its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in six years, suggesting undervaluation. The stock’s average price target, based on 65 analysts, is $170, representing a 41% potential gain from its current price. Notably, 91% of analysts recommend a “Buy,” 9% suggest “Hold,” and none advocate “Sell”.\nNVDA’s top holdings within major ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), account for approximately 6% of the fund’s weight, underscoring its influence in the broader market. Its beta of 1.7 indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500, appealing to traders seeking growth but requiring careful risk management.\nKey Market-Moving News for NVDA as of June 16, 2025\nRecent news highlights NVDA’s critical role in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with several developments shaping its market trajectory. On February 26, 2025, Bank of America reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $190 price target ahead of NVDA’s fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, expecting a modest beat in sales guidance despite challenges from the Blackwell product transition and China restrictions. Evercore ISI also maintained an “Outperform” rating with a $190 target, noting NVDA’s 12% recovery from its February 3 low, though it lagged the S&P 500 by 7% due to concerns over AI demand shifts toward competitors like DeepSeek and ASICs.\nAdditionally, posts on X indicate strong retail sentiment, with NVDA clearing a key resistance at $115 and approaching $124, fueled by anticipation for its May 28, 2025, earnings report. Analysts expect robust earnings driven by AI and gaming sector growth, with some predicting a run-up toward $170 by year-end. These developments highlight NVDA’s resilience and its position as a leading AI innovator, though traders must remain vigilant of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures.\nComparison with a Highly Correlated Stock: TSM\nNVDA shares a high correlation with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a global leader in chip production, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 over the past year. Both companies are integral to the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, with NVDA designing cutting-edge GPUs and TSM manufacturing them. In 2025, TSM has shown similar volatility, with Tickeron’s AI analysis noting its pairing with the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) in trading strategies, yielding up to 104% annualized returns through Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bots. While NVDA’s P/E ratio stands at 28, TSM’s is slightly higher at 30, reflecting strong investor confidence in its manufacturing dominance. However, NVDA’s broader exposure to AI software and gaming gives it a slight edge in growth potential, though TSM’s critical role in chip supply chains ensures its stability.\nTrading NVDA with Inverse ETFs\nFor traders seeking to hedge NVDA’s volatility or capitalize on potential declines, inverse ETFs like the AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NVDS) offer a strategic tool. NVDS is designed to deliver 1.25 times the inverse daily performance of NVDA, making it fully anti-correlated with the stock. Tickeron’s Double Agent Trading Bot combines long NVDA positions with hedged NVDS trades, achieving a 75% success rate by leveraging AI-driven pattern recognition and real-time risk management. This strategy allows traders to profit from NVDA’s bullish trends while mitigating downside risk during market corrections. For instance, in a declining market, the bot posted a +9.77% quarterly gain while the S&P 500 dropped 9.28%, demonstrating the efficacy of pairing NVDA with NVDS for balanced exposure. Traders must exercise caution, as inverse ETFs are best suited for short-term strategies due to their compounding effects and potential for significant losses in prolonged bullish markets.\n\nTickeron’s AI Trading Agents: Revolutionizing NVDA Strategies\nTickeron, under the leadership of CEO Sergey Savastiouk, Ph.D., has transformed trading through its Financial Learning Models (FLMs). These AI-driven models integrate machine learning with technical analysis to identify high-probability trade setups for stocks like NVDA. Tickeron’s AI Trading Bots, including the Double Agent and Single Agent, cater to traders of all levels. The NVDA Swing Trader Bot, for example, optimizes trades by factoring in AI and gaming sector trends, achieving up to 86.6% win rates in volatile markets. These bots provide real-time insights, seamless brokerage integration, and high-liquidity execution, reducing slippage and enhancing profitability. For NVDA, Tickeron’s tools have identified key patterns, such as bullish moving average crossovers and oversold conditions near the lower Bollinger Bands, enabling traders to capitalize on price movements with precision.\n\nRobot factory Trading Results for last 12 months NVDA\nAI Robots (Signal Agents)\n| AI Robot’s Name | P/L |\n| --- | --- |\n| NVDA / NVDS Trading Results AI Trading Double Agent,60min | 111.57% |\n| Swing Trader, Popular Stocks: Price Action Trading Strategy – Pro Version (TA&FA) | 17.01% |\nAI Robots (Virtual Agents)\n| AI Robot’s Name | P/L |\n| --- | --- |\n| NVDA / NVDS Trading Results AI Trading Double Agent, 60 min | 111.74% |\n| Swing Trader: Search for Dips in Top 10 Giants (TA) | 40.95% |\n| Swing Trader: Tracking Dip Trends in Industrial Stocks (TA) – Trading Results | 15.84% |\nAI Robots (Brokerage Agetns)\n\nConclusion: Navigating NVDA’s Future with AI-Driven Insights\nNVIDIA (NVDA) remains a powerhouse in the AI and semiconductor sectors, with strong fundamentals and significant growth potential as of June 16, 2025. Despite recent volatility, its 70% revenue growth, low P/E ratio, and analyst optimism signal a promising outlook.

Should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before June 25? No -- at least, not because of the meeting. That doesn't mean scooping up shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker over the next few days is a bad move, though.\nSome corporate events can provide huge catalysts for stocks. Quarterly earnings releases are one obvious example. Major product announcements are another. Annual shareholder meeting? Not so much. However, there are other reasons you might want to buy Nvidia stock sooner rather than later.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\nWhat Nvidia plans to discuss\nFor the most part, Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting this week will probably be boring. First on the agenda is to elect the board of directors. Unless something truly shocking happens, the nominated slate of directors should be a shoo-in.\nNext up is a vote on advisory approval of executive compensation, commonly referred to as \"say-on-pay.\" This allows shareholders to voice their approval or disapproval of Nvidia's executive compensation plan for the next year. However, the vote isn't binding on the board of directors.\nMaybe the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Nvidia's independent accounting firm will excite some investors, but I doubt it. Either way, it's the next item on the agenda.\nAt last year's annual meeting, shareholders approved a nonbinding proposal requesting the board to eliminate supermajority voting provisions in Nvidia's charter and bylaws. After consideration, the board decided to recommend changing those documents. As a result, eliminating the supermajority voting provisions will be officially voted on at the upcoming meeting (and will, somewhat ironically, require a supermajority vote of 66 2/3% of shareholders to become effective).\nOn a similar note, three stockholder proposals are on the agenda this year:\nNvidia's board recommended shareholders vote against these proposals. Even if the proposals are approved, though, none would affect the stock. It's possible that something interesting could arise during the \"other matters\" part of the company's annual shareholder meeting, but I wouldn't bet on it.\nA more important upcoming event\nIf you're looking for a catalyst for Nvidia stock, you'll probably have to wait a while longer. The next scheduled event that could cause shares to rise won't be until the company reports its fiscal year 2026 second-quarter results on Aug. 27, 2025.\nHowever, it's entirely possible that this Q2 update won't move the needle much. Nvidia would need to blow past earnings estimates or reveal something else that's really positive to have a significant effect on the stock.\nWhy buy Nvidia stock sooner rather than later?\nJust because Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting will likely be a big nothingburger doesn't mean buying the stock hand over fist before June 25 is a bad idea. Actually, for long-term investors, it could be a smart move.\nFrom my perspective, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is only in its early stages, and the rise of AI agents could provide a significant tailwind for Nvidia. So could progress in developing artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nWhile I can imagine a future where Nvidia isn't at the forefront of the AI chip market, I think it's much more likely that the company will remain a key player. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is the best AI chip available. The company's roadmap of new products each year should keep Nvidia ahead of the pack.\nSure, valuation is a perennial objection to buying the stock. I've raised the question myself in the past. However, if the AI market unfolds like I suspect it will, Nvidia's growth will justify its current valuation. Investors won't miss the opportunity if they don't buy the stock before June 25. But if you believe in Nvidia's potential, there's no time like the present.\nKeith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

      "text": "Nvidia (NVDA 2.19%) will hold its 2025 shareholder meeting in three days. Should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before June 25? No -- at least, not because of the meeting.
